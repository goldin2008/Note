# Python for DevOps

The world has changed a lot in the last decade: Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, the cloud is ubiquitous, and data is hot. And everyone needs some type of automation. With software systems, for every failed perfect solution that was never implemented, there’s a reasonable solution that could have improved things.

Join expert Noah Gift to learn fiercely effective ways to “get stuff done” in Python using Google Colab, an interactive Jupyter environment, with hands-on code examples. Along the way, you’ll learn to embrace imperfect, but useful, automation. You’ll never look at a boring task the same way again.
