They highlight examples of what is expected of employees as they carry out their day-to-day responsibilities, are displayed in me@upme, and should be considered when setting Performance Goals and completing the Annual Review.

1 - Business Results
Deliver the goals of your team, business/ function and the company
Describe accomplishments and delivery for the full year. Be specific with facts and examples on both results ("what") and behaviors ("how") on how it was achieved against expectations for your level. Include any additional considerations or factors in the context of the environment this year.

I joined the team in May, 2023. During my onboarding, I get familiar with the tools and platform in the firm as quickly as possible. Since some team member left the team pretty soon after I joined the team, I took over the responsibility of the modeling and made it ready for deployment. Meanwhile, I also spent time and effort in engineering such as using postman, EMR cluster to build model and generate inferences in DEV, UAT and PROD environment and document the details about implementation and model results analysis to make other team members to understand the entire workflow easily.


Aligning Priorities with Business Strategy:
From I joined the team, I have diligently aligned my work priorities with the broader business strategy. I have consistently stayed informed about the firm's goals and objectives, ensuring that our data science and machine learning projects are well-aligned with these strategic goals. The access insights project will improve privileged access management across the firm, while new hire onboarding project makes new hire over the company easier to begin their journey as easily and quickly as possible. These projects can save a lot of time and effort in reviewing and managing access and reduce the cost in cloud storage, which will not only saved the company valuable resources but also ensured that we use our assets efficiently.

Managing Costs and Resources Effectively:


Prioritizing and Delivering Results:
I have prioritized my responsibilities effectively and delivered results that have contributed to achieving our business objectives. This includes developing and implementing machine learning models that have improved decision-making, customer experiences, and operational efficiency, directly impacting the bottom line.
I prioritized the knowledge transfer when team member left during my onboarding to make sure there is no gap or blocker in our road to the production. I spent a lot of time and effort, even in my spare time, to make our project go to production in a relatively short term. So far, the access insights project already went to production and the new hire onboarding project is during the good progress.



Eliminating Bureaucracy and Issue Identification:
When faced with obstacles, I have been proactive in identifying issues and escalating them as needed. This approach has been vital in resolving challenges swiftly, thus preventing potential bottlenecks and ensuring the smooth progress of our projects.
During the backlog refinement and sprint planning meetings, I identified a data quality issue that had the potential to undermine the accuracy of our machine learning models. I promptly escalated the issue, leading to a resolution that prevented significant data-related errors in our predictions. The swift resolution of the data quality issue prevented potential losses and maintained the trustworthiness of our models.


Process Improvement:
I have consistently identified opportunities to enhance the quality and productivity of our projects. 
I identified a model and metrics selection issue that will affect the model performance. By sharing another advanced model option which could handle with more informative data, we can make model performance better. The advacned model can also build our team's reputation across the firm and provide our solution to more potential internal users.

Running Disciplined Meetings:
I have conducted disciplined meetings with clear purposes and agendas, involving the right individuals. These meetings have been highly productive, resulting in clear outcomes and next steps, which has minimized wasted time and improved collaboration within the team.
When we encountered the OmniAI platform issue, I organized and led meetings with a clear agenda and specific goals. This disciplined approach led to more efficient discussions, reduced meeting times, and allowed the team to focus on implementation. This allows our team to proactively plan and mitigate the risk in model development.


Rapid Onboarding and Taking on Modeling Responsibilities:
During my onboarding, I quickly familiarized myself with the firm's tools and platforms. Given the unexpected departure of team members soon after my arrival, I took on the critical responsibility of modeling, ensuring its readiness for deployment. Simultaneously, I invested time and effort in engineering tasks, leveraging tools like Postman and EMR clusters to build and deploy models across DEV, UAT, and PROD environments. I also meticulously documented the implementation details and model results analysis to facilitate easy understanding for other team members.

Aligning Priorities with Business Strategy:
Since my arrival, I've diligently aligned my work priorities with the broader business strategy. This commitment is evident in projects such as "Access Insights," which enhances privileged access management, and the "New Hire Onboarding" project, streamlining the onboarding process for new hires. These projects not only improve operational efficiency but also contribute to significant cost savings in cloud storage, optimizing our resource utilization.

Managing Costs and Resources Effectively:
My proactive approach to knowledge transfer and relentless efforts in my spare time have expedited project deployment. "Access Insights" has successfully transitioned to production, and the "New Hire Onboarding" project is making substantial progress, ensuring swift achievement of our objectives.

Eliminating Bureaucracy and Issue Identification:
Identifying and addressing data quality issues during backlog refinement and sprint planning meetings has been a priority. These proactive efforts have maintained the trustworthiness of our models and prevented potential losses, reinforcing our commitment to quality and reliability.

Process Improvement:
I consistently seek opportunities to enhance the quality and productivity of our projects. My efforts in identifying model and metrics selection issues and introducing advanced models have not only improved model performance but also enhanced our team's reputation within the firm, opening doors to more potential internal users.

Running Disciplined Meetings:
In the face of challenges, I have consistently organized and led meetings with clear purposes and agendas. These disciplined meetings have resulted in more efficient discussions, reduced meeting times, and an increased focus on implementation. This approach has allowed our team to proactively address issues and mitigate risks in model development.
