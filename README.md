I joined the team in May, 2023. During my onboarding, I get familiar with the tools and platform in the firm as quickly as possible. Since some team member left the team pretty soon after I joined the team, I took over the responsibility of the modeling and made it ready for deployment. Meanwhile, I also spent time and effort in engineering such as using postman, EMR cluster to build model and generate inferences in DEV, UAT and PROD environment and document the details about implementation and model results analysis to make other team members to understand the entire workflow easily.

Prioritizing and Delivering Results:
I have prioritized my responsibilities effectively and delivered results that have contributed to achieving our business objectives. This includes developing and implementing machine learning models that have improved decision-making, customer experiences, and operational efficiency, directly impacting the bottom line.
I prioritized the knowledge transfer when team member left during my onboarding to make sure there is no gap or blocker in our road to the production. I spent a lot of time and effort, even in my spare time, to make our project go to production in a relatively short term. So far, the access insights project already went to production and the new hire onboarding project is during the good progress.

Rapid Onboarding and Taking on Modeling Responsibilities:
During my onboarding, I quickly familiarized myself with the firm's tools and platforms. Given the unexpected departure of team members soon after my arrival, I took on the critical responsibility of modeling, ensuring its readiness for deployment. Simultaneously, I invested time and effort in engineering tasks, leveraging tools like Postman and EMR clusters to build and deploy models across DEV, UAT, and PROD environments. I also meticulously documented the implementation details and model results analysis to facilitate easy understanding for other team members.

Aligning Priorities with Business Strategy:
Since my arrival, I've diligently aligned my work priorities with the broader business strategy. This commitment is evident in projects such as "Access Insights," which enhances privileged access management, and the "New Hire Onboarding" project, streamlining the onboarding process for new hires. These projects not only improve operational efficiency but also contribute to significant cost savings in cloud storage, optimizing our resource utilization.

Managing Costs and Resources Effectively:
My proactive approach to knowledge transfer and relentless efforts in my spare time have expedited project deployment. "Access Insights" has successfully transitioned to production, and the "New Hire Onboarding" project is making substantial progress, ensuring swift achievement of our objectives.

Eliminating Bureaucracy and Issue Identification:
Identifying and addressing data quality issues during backlog refinement and sprint planning meetings has been a priority. These proactive efforts have maintained the trustworthiness of our models and prevented potential losses, reinforcing our commitment to quality and reliability.

Process Improvement:
I consistently seek opportunities to enhance the quality and productivity of our projects. My efforts in identifying model and metrics selection issues and introducing advanced models have not only improved model performance but also enhanced our team's reputation within the firm, opening doors to more potential internal users.

Running Disciplined Meetings:
In the face of challenges, I have consistently organized and led meetings with clear purposes and agendas. These disciplined meetings have resulted in more efficient discussions, reduced meeting times, and an increased focus on implementation. This approach has allowed our team to proactively address issues and mitigate risks in model development.

2 - Client / Customer / Stakeholder
Identify and deliver appropriate solutions that address the needs of clients / customers/ stakeholders
Describe the solutions identified and delivered that addressed the needs of your clients/customers/stakeholders while balancing the needs of the firm. Do not include confidential information on clients/customers/deals.

CLIENT/CUSTOMER/STAKEHOLDER*

In the "Access Insights" project, I proactively identified and addressed the needs of our internal users. Engaging in thoughtful discussions with my team members and our manager, we explored various options to cater to our customers' requirements and enhance the overall user experience. This proactive approach has not only improved user satisfaction but also reinforced our project's success.

Cross-Team Collaboration:
I have been a proactive advocate for cross-team collaboration, actively engaging with colleagues from the HR Data Science team to leverage their expertise, products, and services. I've invested significant time and effort into researching and analyzing their models, and my findings, concerns, and suggestions have played a pivotal role in shaping our collective solutions. This collaboration ensures that our projects are comprehensive and well-rounded, enriched by diverse perspectives and expertise.

Alignment with Firm Priorities:
My solutions have consistently aligned with our firm's strategic priorities. I have made it a personal mission to understand our company's goals and to ensure that the projects and solutions I lead are in direct support of these objectives. This alignment has been paramount in delivering value to our clients, customers, and stakeholders that resonates with our firm's overarching mission. In direct response to the firm's strategic priority of sustainability, I spearheaded the development of a machine learning model that optimized privileged access management. This solution not only upheld our firm's sustainability commitment but also resulted in substantial cost reductions in cloud compute and storage, contributing to our financial well-being.
