intro to ML

AI is changing the way we work and live and this nontechnical course will teach you how to navigate the rise of AI. Whether you want to know what's behind the buzzwords or whether you want to perhaps use AI yourself either in a personal context or in a corporation or other organization, this course will teach you how. If you want to understand how AI is affecting society, and how you can navigate that, you also learn that from this course.

One of the reasons for this is because AI is actually two separate ideas. Almost all the progress we are seeing in the AI today is artificial narrow intelligence. These are AIs that do one thing such as a smart speaker or a self-driving car or AI to do web search or AI applications in farming or in a factory. These types of AI are one trick ponies but when you find the appropriate trick, this can be incredibly valuable. Unfortunately, AI also refers to a second concept of AGI or artificial general intelligence. That is the goal to build AI. They can do anything a human can do or maybe even be superintelligence and do even more things than any human can. I'm seeing tons of progress in ANI, artificial narrow intelligence and almost no progress to what AGI or artificial general intelligence. Both of these are worthy goals and unfortunately the rapid progress in ANI which is incredibly valuable, that has caused people to conclude that there's a lot of progress in AI, which is true. But that has caused people to falsely think that there might be a lot of progress in AGI as well which is leading to some irrational fears about evil clever robots coming over to take over humanity anytime now. I think AGI is an exciting goal for researchers to work on, but it'll take most for technological breakthroughs before we get there and it may be decades or hundreds of years or even thousands of years away. Given how far away AGI is, I think there is no need to unduly worry about it.

 In this week, you will learn what ANI can do and how to apply them to your problems. Later in this, course you'll also see some case studies of how ANI, this one trick ponies can be used to build really valuable applications such as smart speakers and self-driving cars. In this week, you will learn why this AI. You may have heard of machine learning and the next video will teach you what is machine learning. You also learn what is data and what types of data are valuable but also what does the data are not valuable. You learn what it is that makes a company an AI company or an AI first company so that perhaps you can start thinking if there are ways to improve your company or other organizations ability to use AI and importantly, you also learned this week what machine learning can and cannot do. 

 n our society, newspapers as well as research papers tend to talk only about the success stories of machine learning and AI and we hardly ever see any failure stories because they just aren't as interesting to report on. But for you to have a realistic view of what AI and what machine learning can or cannot do, I think is important that you see examples of both so that you can make more accurate judgements about what you may and maybe should not try to use these technologies for.

 Finally, a lot of the recent rise of, machine learning has been driven through the rise of Deep Learning. Sometimes also called Neural Networks. In the final two optional videos of this week, you can also see an intuitive explanation of deep learning so that you will better understand what they can do particularly for a set of narrow ANI tasks. So, that's what you learn this week and by the end of this week, you have a sense of AI technologies and what they can and cannot do. In the second week, you'll learn how these AI technologies can be used to build valuable projects. You learn what it feels like to build an AI project as what as what you should do to make sure you select projects that are technically feasible as well as valuable to you or your business or other organization. After learning what it takes to build AI projects, in the third week you'll learn how to build AI in your company. In particular, if you want to take a few steps toward making your company good at AI, you see the AI transformation playbook and learn how to build AI teams and also built complex AI products. Finally, AI is having a huge impact on society. In a fourth and final week, you'll learn about how AI systems can be bias and how to diminish or eliminate such biases. You also learn how AI is affecting developing economies and how AI is affecting jobs and be better able to navigate this rise of AI for yourself and for your organization. By the end of this four recourse, you'll be more knowledgeable and better qualified than even the CEOs of most large companies in terms of your understanding of AI technology as well as your ability to help yourself or your company or other organization navigate the rise of AI as I hope that after this course, you'll be in a position to provide leadership to others as well as they navigate these issues. Now, one of the major technologies driving the recent rise of AI is Machine Learning. But what is Machine Learning? Let's take a look in the next video.

Machine Learning:

The rise of AI has been largely driven by one tool in AI called machine learning. In this video, you'll learn what is machine learning, so that by the end, you hope we will start thinking how machine learning might be applied to your company or to your industry. The most commonly used type of machine learning is a type of AI that learns A to B, or input to output mappings. This is called supervised learning. Let's see some examples. If the input A is an email and the output B one is email spam or not, zero one. Then this is the core piece of AI used to build a spam filter. I'll define these terms more precise in later video, so don't worry too much about what it means for now.
The most important idea in AI has been machine learning, has basically supervised learning, which means A to B, or input to output mappings. What enables it to work really well is data. In the next video, let's take a look at what is the data and what data you might already have? And how to think about feeding this into AI systems. Let's go on to the next video.

I'll try to give you a sense of what some of these terms mean in later videos as well. But the most important tools that I hope you know about are machine learning and data science as well as deep learning and neural networks, which are a very powerful way to do machine learning, and sometimes data science. If we were to draw a Venn diagram showing how all these concepts put together, this is what it may look like. AI is this huge set of tools for making computers behave intelligently. Off AI, the biggest subset is prairie tools from machine learning, but AI does have other tools than machine learning, such as some of these buzzwords, are listed at the bottom. The part of machine learning that's most important these days is neural networks or deep learning, which is a very powerful set of tools for carrying out supervised learning or A to B mappings as well as some other things. But there are also other machine learning tools that are not just deep learning tools. So, how does data science fit into this picture? There is inconsistency in how the terminology is used. Some people will tell you data science is a subset of AI. Some people will tell you AI is a subset of data science. So, it depends on who you ask. But I would say that data science is maybe a cross-cutting subset of all of these tools that uses many tools from AI machine learning and deep learning, but has some other separate tools as well that solves a very set of important problems in driving business insights. In this video, you saw what is machine learning, what is data science, and what is deep learning and neural networks. I hope this gives you a sense of the most common and important terminology using AI, and you can start thinking about how these things might apply to your company. Now, what does it mean for a company to be good at AI? Let's talk about that in the next video.

Data:

What makes an AI company:

What machine learning can and cannot do:

How to choose an AI project:
Machine learning is an “iterative” process, meaning that an AI team often has to try many ideas before coming up with something that’s good enough, rather than have the first thing they try work.
Say you want to use Machine Learning to help your sales team with automatic lead sorting. I.e., Input A (a sales prospect) and output B (whether your sales team should prioritize them). The 3 steps of the workflow, in scrambled order, are:
(i) Deploy a trained model and get data back from users
(ii) Collect data with both A and B
(iii) Train a machine learning system to input A and output B

Say you want to build an AI system to help recruiters with automated resume screening. Which of these steps might be involved in “technical diligence” process?  (Select all that apply.)
Defining an engineering timeline
Making sure you can get enough data for this project
Ensuring that this is valuable for your business (e.g., estimating the project ROI)
Making sure that an AI system can meet the desired performance

Which of these statements about “business diligence” do you agree with?
Business diligence is the process of ensuring that the envisioned AI technology is feasible.
Business diligence is the process of ensuring that the AI technology, if it is built, is valuable for your business.

Pitfall:
Before wrapping up this video one pitfall I want to urge you to avoid is expecting a 100% accuracy from your AI software. Here's what I mean, let's say this is your test set which you've already seen on the last slide. But, let me add a few more examples to this test set. Here are some of the reasons it may not be possible for a piece of AI software to be a 100% accurate. First, machine learning technology today despite being very powerful still has limitations and they just can't do everything. So, you may be working on a problem that it's just very difficult even for today's machine learning technology. Second, insufficient data. If you don't have enough data specifically if you don't have enough training data for the AI software to learn from it may be very difficult to get a very high level of accuracy. Third, data is messy and sometimes data can be mislabeled. For example, this green coffee mug here looks perfectly okay to me, so, the label of it being a defect looks like an incorrect label and that would hurt the performance of your AI software. Data can also be ambiguous.

AI technical tools:
Finally, you might hear about Cloud versus On-premises, or for short, On-prem deployments. Cloud deployments refer to if you rent compute servers such as from Amazon's AWS, or Microsoft's Azure, or Google's GCP in order to use someone else's service to do your computation. Whereas, an On-prem deployment means buying your own compute servers and running the service locally in your own company. A detailed exploration of the pros and cons of these two options is beyond the scope of this video. A lot of the world is moving to Cloud deployments. Whether you search online you find many articles talking about the pros and cons of Cloud versus On-prem deployments. 

Building AI in your company:
week3

As you can tell both from this rather complex example of an AI pipeline, as well as the early example of the four-step AI pipeline for the smart speaker, sometimes it takes a team to build all of these different components of a complex AI product. What I'd like to do in the next video is share with you what are the key roles in large AI teams. If you're either a one-person or small AI team now, that's okay, but I want you to have a vision of what building a large AI team, maybe in the distant future, might look like.

 I hope this survey of AI application areas gives you a sense that the wide range of data that AI is successfully applied to today, and maybe this even inspire you to think of how some of these application areas may be useful for your own projects. Now, so far the one AI technique we've spent the most time talking about is supervised learning. That means learning inputs, output, or A to B mappings from labeled data where you give the AI system both A and B. But that's not the only AI technique out there. In fact, the term supervised learning almost invites the question of what is unsupervised learning, or you might also have heard from media articles, from the news about reinforcement learning. So, what are all these other techniques? In the next video, the final optional video for this week, we'll do a survey of AI techniques, and I hope that through that maybe you'll see if some of these other AI techniques and supervised learning could be useful for your projects as well. Let's go on to the final optional video for the week.
