## API design interview
Remember the differences between safe and unsafe methods. As well as idempotent or not. Be able to explain why you decided to use post instead of put. Or why using query Params instead of the payload. Remember query params have length limits. If going more complicated remember apis other than rest. Like streaming endpoints and when to use those. Research things like object expansion and when to use if you want to impress.

design有两个track一个product，一个backend，backend就是偏向于distrubuted system design，product就是纯api design, recruiter在面之前应该会说的啊
