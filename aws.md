#### Non-relational Stores
- `Key Value Databases`
  - `Key-value databases` are a type of non-relational database that offer a simple yet powerful data model, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data based on unique keys using distributed hash tables. This design principle, which revolves around mapping keys to their corresponding values, provides a highly scalable and flexible approach to data management. In this section, we will delve into the architecture and design considerations of key-value stores, uncovering the inner workings of these streamlined databases.
  - Open-source key-value databases provide developers with flexible and scalable solutions for managing data in a distributed and highly available manner. One popular open-source key-value store, Dynamo, has gained significant attention and adoption.
  `Dynamo` is a highly available and scalable key-value store developed by Amazon. It was designed to handle the demanding requirements of Amazon’s shopping cart service. While Dynamo itself is not open-source, its principles have influenced the development of various open-source implementations such as Riak, Voldemort, and Dynomite.
- `Document Databases`
  - `Document databases` are a type of non-relational database that are specifically designed for storing, retrieving, and managing semi-structured data in the form of documents. They provide a flexible and schema-less approach to data storage, making them ideal for applications with dynamic and evolving data structures. In this section, we will explore the architecture and design considerations of document stores, shedding light on their key features and benefits.
  - `MongoDB` is a widely adopted open-source document database known for its scalability, performance, and developer-friendly features. It uses a flexible JSON-like document model, allowing developers to store and retrieve data in a schema-less manner. MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, which means that each document in a collection can have its own unique structure.
- `Columnar Databases`
  - `Columnar databases` or column-family databases, also known as Wide column stores, are a type of non-relational database that offer a unique architecture optimized for handling vast amounts of structured and semi-structured data. These databases excel at managing large-scale distributed systems, analytics, and use cases requiring fast read and write performance. In this section, we will explore the architecture and design considerations of wide column stores, unveiling their key features and advantages.
  - `Apache Cassandra` is a highly scalable and distributed open-source columnar database known for its ability to handle massive amounts of structured and semi-structured data across multiple commodity servers. It offers a robust architecture and a range of features that make it suitable for high-performance and fault-tolerant applications. Let’s delve into Apache Cassandra and explore its key features.
- `Graph Databases`
  - `Graph databases` are a specialized type of non-relational database designed to handle highly interconnected data and complex relationships. They excel at storing, querying, and traversing graph-like structures, making them ideal for scenarios involving social networks, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs. In this section, we will explore the architecture and design considerations of graph stores, uncovering their key features and advantages.
  - `Neo4j` is a leading open-source graph database known for its powerful graph processing capabilities and intuitive query language. Neo4j is designed to efficiently store, manage, and traverse highly connected data, making it ideal for applications that heavily rely on complex relationships and interconnections.
