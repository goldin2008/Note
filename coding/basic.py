"""
Merge Sort
merge() has a linear runtime. This leads to a runtime complexity of O(n).
The second step splits the input array recursively and calls merge() for each half.
Since the array is halved until a single element remains, the total number of
halving operations performed by this function is log2n. Since merge() is called
for each half, we get a total runtime of O(nlog2n).
Pros:
Cons: Both bubble sort and insertion sort beat merge sort when sorting a ten-element list.
merge sort use much more memory than bubble sort and insertion sort, which are both able
to sort the list in place. Due to this limitation, you may not want to use merge sort 
to sort large lists in memory-constrained hardware.
