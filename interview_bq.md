#### Amazon LP
1. Earn Trust 不自傲自满,自我批判,敢于承认错误
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
Earn trust可以通过很多不同的方式: Fail了勇于承担错误和责任, 接受来自同事老板的批评建议努力改进, 帮助同事(完成一项工作, 或者帮助改善工作表现)，勇于提出建议和坚持自己意见改善组里的效率, 衡量利弊后顺从组里其他人或者多数人的意见，加入一个新组但迅速通过工作获得信任。所以应该按问题准备故事, 而不是按照LP。上面的问题同样的color code其实可以用同一个故事来回答, 当然你有很多经验apply的话一类问题准备多个故事当然最好, 因为他们问的问题很多overlap, 能给每个人讲不一样的故事当然最好咯。

2. Dive Deep 愿意刨根问底,有能力troubleshoot到根本问题,解决问题
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

3. Customer Obsession 顾客至上, do the best for customers and the rest will come
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
Fraud Risk Model to improve customer experience. make customer life easier

4. Bias for Action 速度很重要, 数据不足的时候，衡量利弊，想好backup plan，敢于冒险
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
5. Invent and Simplify 创新,简化, 多research借鉴别人已有的方法提高效率也很好
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
Built pipeline to simplify retrain and refit cycle. solve complex problem in a simple way

6. Are right, A Lot 大多数时候正确，努力证明自己正确, 说服别人
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
7. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 不趋附大众,敢于提出自己的意见
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
Use ML based solution to replace current heuristic.

8. Deliver Results 排除万难,最后完成任务, 或者最终失败学到了什么
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
我的项目launch A/B test发现performance不好。然后我dive deep into it，首先check 有没有engineering bugs；然后check 模型performance是不是和offline metrics match；然后check feature distribution有没有shift。然后我发现了问题所在。然后我做了这几个change，然后重新上线了，performance improve x%
显示出一个系统性逻辑性的解决问题方法。而高级的回答显示出了面试者quantitative and critical thinking的mindset

9. Insist on the Highest Standards 不妥协自己的高要求
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
In DS team, insist the code quality and standards even it will take some time to implement and trade-off balance.

10. Learn and Be Curious 学习工作外的事情
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Learn a lot engineering and cloud knowledge to understand the entire ml life cycle and make it easier to collaborate with tech and business teams. Study and get AWS solution architecture and ML certificates.

11. Ownership 不只顾着自己的一亩三分地, 为了长期利益履行工作分外的职责; sacrifice short-term profit for long-term gain
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
Balance modeling and engineering.

12. Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
13. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.
14. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
15. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
16. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### 15 top behavioral interview questions
Depending on the position you’re conducting an interview for, you can incorporate some or all of the following 15 behavioral interview questions into the process. Doing so will help you identify the right candidate for your organization.

1. Can you give me an example of a difficult problem you solved at work? How did you go about reaching a solution?
`proudest achievement`, `conflict`

2. Tell me about a time when you made a mistake. How did you handle this experience?
`failure`

3. Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge. How did you overcome this challenge?
`failure`, `conflict`

4. Can you tell me about a time when things didn’t work out well?
`failure`

5. Tell me about a time when you had to develop a new skill. How do you approach the learning process?
`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
- The best way to pick it up is via learning by doing
If you’re still keen on becoming more end-to-end, we’ll now discuss how to do so. Before that, without going into specific technology, here are the buckets of skills that end-to-end data scientists commonly use:
Product: Understand customer problems, define and prioritize requirements
Communication: Facilitate across teams, get buy-in, write docs, share results
Data engineering: Move and transform data from point A to B
Data analysis: Understand and visualize data, A/B testing & inference
Machine learning: The usual plus experimentation, implementation, and metrics
Software engineering: Production code practices including unit tests, docs, logging
Dev Ops: Basic containerization and cloud proficiency, build and automation tools
(This list is neither mandatory nor exhaustive. Most projects don’t require all of them.)
Here are four ways you can move closer to being an end-to-end data scientist:
- Study the right books and courses. (Okay, this is not learning by doing but we all need to start somewhere). I would focus on courses that cover tacit knowledge rather than specific tools. While I’ve not come across such materials, I’ve heard good reviews about Full Stack Deep Learning.
- Do your own projects end-to-end to get first-hand experience of the entire process. At the risk of oversimplifying it, here are some steps I would take with their associated skills. I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. – Confucius
Start with identifying a problem to solve and determining the success metric (product). Then, find some raw data (i.e., not Kaggle competition data); this lets you clean and prepare the data and create features (data engineering). Next, try various ML models, examining learning curves, error distributions, and evaluation metrics (data science).
Assess each model’s performance (e.g., query latency, memory footprint) before picking one and writing a basic inference class around it for production (software engineering). (You might also want to build a simple user interface). Then, containerise and deploy it online for others to use via your preferred cloud provider (dev ops).
Once that’s done, go the extra mile to share about your work. You could write an article for your site or speak about it at a meetup (communication). Show what you found in the data via meaningful visuals and tables (data analysis). Share your work on GitHub. Learning and working in public is a great way to get feedback and find potential collaborators.
- Volunteer through groups like DataKind. DataKind works with social organizations (e.g., NGOs) and data professionals to address humanitarian issues. By collaborating with these NGOs, you get the opportunity to work as part of a team to tackle real problems with real(ly messy) data.
While volunteers may be assigned specific roles (e.g., PM, DS), you’re always welcome to tag along and observe. You’ll see (and learn) how PMs engage with NGOs to frame the problem, define solutions, and organize the team around it. You’ll learn from fellow volunteers how to work with data to develop working solutions.
- Join a startup-like team. Note: A startup-like team is not synonymous with a startup. There are big organizations that run teams in a startup-like manner (e.g., two-pizza teams) and startups made up of specialists. Find a lean team where you’re encouraged, and have the opportunity, to work end-to-end.


6. Please share a time when you had to share or pitch an idea to someone in a more senior position. How did you go about this task, and what was the outcome?
`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
- The goal of data science is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop new business capabilities. … There are no blueprints; these are new capabilities with inherent uncertainty. … All the elements you’ll need must be learned through experimentation, trial and error, and iteration. – Eric Colson
He suggests that data science roles should be made more general, with broad responsibilities agnostic to technical function and optimized for learning. Thus, his team hires and grows generalists who can conceptualize, model, implement, and measure. Of course, this is dependent on a solid data platform that abstracts away the complexities of infra setup, distributed processing, monitoring, automated failover, etc.
Having end-to-end data scientists improved Stitch Fix’s learning and innovation capabilities, enabling them to discover and build more business capabilities (relative to a specialist team).
Netflix Edge Engineering initially had specialized roles. However, this created inefficiencies across the product life cycle. Code releases took more time (weeks instead of days), deployment problems took longer to detect and resolve, and production issues required multiple back-and-forth communications.
To address this, they experimented with Full Cycle Developers who were empowered to work across the entire software life cycle. This required a mindset shift—instead of just considering design and development, devs also had to consider deployment and reliability.
To support full cycle devs, centralized teams built tooling to automate and simplify common development process (e.g., build and deploy pipelines, monitoring, managed rollbacks). Such tooling is reusable across multiple teams, acts as a force multiplier, and helped devs be effective across the entire cycle.
With the full cycle developer approach, Edge Engineering was able to iterate quicker (instead of coordinating across teams), with faster and more routine deployments.
Data science is part software engineering, part research and innovation, and fully about using data to create impact and value. Aspects of data science that work well with agile tend to be more of the engineering nature, while those closer related to research tends not to fit as well.
-  my examples
At IBM, I was on a team that created job recommendations for staff. Running the entire pipeline took a very long time. I thought we could halve the time by moving the data prep and feature engineering pipelines into the database. But, the database guy didn’t have time to test this. Being impatient, I ran some benchmarks and reduced overall run time by 90%. This allowed us to experiment 10x faster and save on compute cost in production.
While building Lazada’s ranking system, I found Spark necessary for data pipelines (due to the large data volume). However, our cluster only supported the Scala API which I was unfamiliar with. Not wanting to wait (for data engineering support), I chose the faster—but painful—route of figuring out Scala Spark and writing the pipelines myself. This likely halved dev time and gave me a better understanding of the data to build a better model.
After a successful A/B test, we found that business stakeholders didn’t trust the model. As a result, they were manually picking top products to display, decreasing online metrics (e.g., CTR, conversion). To understand more, I made trips to our marketplaces (e.g., Indonesia, Vietnam). Through mutual education, we were able to address their concerns and reduce the amount of manual overwriting and reap the gains.
In the examples above, going out of the regular DS & ML job scope helped with delivering more value, faster. In the last example, it was necessary to unblock our data science efforts.
You may not be end-to-end now. That’s okay—few people are. Nonetheless, consider its benefits and stretching closer towards it.
Which aspects would disproportionately improve your ability to deliver as a data scientist? Increased engagement with customers and stakeholders to design more holistic, innovative solutions? Building and orchestrating your own data pipelines? Greater awareness of engineering and product constraints for faster integration and deployments?
- A couple months after publishing this, I realize some readers interpret this post from the skills and technical knowledge perspective. They see this post as pushing for data scientists / ML engineers to be full-stack and have in-depth knowledge of how to set up K8s, do PhD-level research, design front-end, etc. That’s not my intention.
Instead, I’m trying to convince that end-to-end visibility, cohesion (i.e., reverse Conway’s Law), and ownership leads to better outcomes. Although visibility should be paired with ability to make an impact, for a start, its sufficient to be able to use the tools without being able to set it up yourself. The effective data scientists I know are power users of their tools even without being able to set it up from scratch (though I’m sure they can pick it up fast).

as MLE to solve DS issues.
Difficult clients are part of any business, particularly fields such as customer service and sales. Clients can place unrealistic demands, refuse to listen and even become rude, but it’s important to remain professional no matter what. Being able to resolve situations with difficult clients is an important skill in itself that indicates professionalism, grace and patience.
For me, the first step in dealing with a difficult client is getting on the same page. When things don’t go a person’s way, they often assume you’re malicious and become defensive. Of course, this isn’t the case, and my first priority is proving this. Once I reassure a difficult client that their success is also in my best interest, it always becomes easier to resolve their problem.
- First and foremost, listen. Do not try to talk over the customer or argue with them. Let the customer have their say, even if you know what they are going to say next, that they don't have all the information or that they are mistaken. As you listen, take the opportunity to build rapport with the customer.
- Build rapport through empathy. Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Echo the source of their frustration and show that you understand their position and situation. If you can empathize with a customer's problem, it will help calm them down.
- Lower your voice. If the customer gets louder, speak slowly, in a low tone. Your calm demeanor can carry over to them and help them to settle down. As you approach the situation with a calm, clear mind, unaffected by the customer's tone or volume, their anger will generally dissipate.
- Respond as if all your customers are watching. Pretend you are not talking only to the customer but to an audience that is watching the interaction. This shift in perspective can provide an emotional buffer if the customer is being verbally abusive and will allow you to think more clearly when responding. Since an unruly customer can be a negative referral, assume they'll repeat the conversation to other potential customers; this mindset can help you do your best to address their concerns in a calming way.
- Stay calm. If the customer is swearing or being verbally abusive, take a deep breath and continue as if you didn't hear them. Responding in kind will not solve anything, and it will usually escalate the situation. Instead, remind the customer that you are there to help them and are their best immediate chance of resolving the situation. This simple statement often helps defuse the situation.
- Remember that you're interacting with a human. Everyone has an occasional bad day. Maybe your rude customer had a fight with their spouse, got a traffic ticket that morning or had a recent run of bad luck. We've all been there, to some degree. Try to empathize and make their day better by being a pleasant, calming voice – it'll make you feel good, too.
- Summarize the next steps. At the end of the call, let the customer know exactly what to expect, and then be sure to follow through on your promises. Document the call to ensure you're well prepared for the next interaction.
- I would always answer this question by talking about being flexible, understanding and patient.
Flexibility - Different users require a different approach, some will need hand holding, others just need the issue resolved. You need to be able to change the way you speak/act for the different people and their different moods.
Understanding/Empathy - Understand not only their technical issue but also their driver, are they being difficult because they are stressed/under pressure to deliver or frustrated because they do not understand the issue? Understanding the root issue of why someone is being difficult is the first step in making them feel like they are getting the assistance and service they require and also it will make you less mad at them for being a pain in the arse!
Patience - An obvious one but this goes along way. So long as you've grasped the fact the customer is angry, acknowledged that and you are speaking to them in a suitable manor for them, you simply need to have patience to 'take their shit' and resolve their issue or come to an agreed course of action. If you ever feel that you are becoming angry, take a step back from the call.
Follow up - If its appropriate, always follow up the issue. This is a two fold thing, firstly it ensures you've resolved the issue and they are happy (from a difficult customer to a happy customer is what you're aiming for) and secondly, it raises you and the department, it proves not only that you are interested in resolving the issue but also you are happy to deal with this customer again in the future and you want to ensure you've done all you can - even if they are still being difficult.

In addition to listing techniques you’d use when dealing with a difficult customer, support your claims with an anecdote. Sharing a detailed example of how you’ve employed the above strategies when handling real life customer conflict is an effective way to reinforce how you’d handle hypothetical situations in the future.  Follow the STAR method to successfully tell a conflict resolution success story.
Situation. Keep your explanation simple, but tell your story using enough context for the employer to get a clear picture.
Task. It’s important to describe your role / responsibility both on the job and in the situation.
Action. Describe how you implemented the strategies listed above, and any additional techniques of your own, to find a resolution.
Result. Make sure to mention the specific positive conclusion that was reached, and anything further that may have resulted such as a positive review, or referral, etc.

Listen carefully to the customer.  When a customer is upset, the first thing they want is an opportunity to air their grievances. An employer is looking to hear that you’ll take some time to hear them out, which involves listening patiently, and asking follow-up questions. Be sure to highlight the importance of body language, posture, and eye contact – for example, standing or sitting up straight with uncrossed arms will come across to a customer as welcoming and attentive.

Repeat what you’ve just heard. Summarizing and reiterating the customer’s main concerns will ensure they feel understood, maximize your understanding of their complaint, and provide them with some time to (hopefully) calm down a bit.

Remain calm and compassionate. One of the most important qualities an interviewer is looking for with regard to a difficult customer is a candidate’s ability to remain calm during tense interactions. Speaking in an even tone is an important strategy to mention, as it typically prevents a situation from escalating too far. Reminding yourself that the customer isn’t angry with you, but dissatisfied with product performance or a provided service, will help you avoid taking anything personally.

9. Tell me about a time when you experienced conflict at work. How did you overcome it?
`failure`, `conflict`

10. What’s one thing you’ve done in your professional history that you wish you would have handled differently?
`failure`, `conflict`

11. As a leader, how do you motivate those who follow you?
https://www.universalcreativesolutions.com/insights/11-effective-leadership-strategies-to-motivate-your-team
`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
allocate tasks to proper individuals
Those in leadership positions need to be able to motivate their subordinates. Good morale is one of the keys to maximizing the quality of work, as well as quantity. By learning how a person motivates their team members, you’ll gain a look into their interpersonal skills, maturity and knack for management.
I believe that when you set people up to succeed while doing work they’re good at, they motivate themselves. I get to know my team members as individuals, make use of their unique skills and show my appreciation and awareness for the contributions they make.

- Ask them Communicate
Communicate (in a way that not only informs, but inspires).
Explain exactly what you need, by when, and why. Explaining the bigger picture lets others see how their contributions will matter and provides the context needed to make better decisions about how to accomplish tasks.
Start with scheduling more one on one time. Get off on the right track by making consistent clear goals and expectations an operational reality. You do that through the lost art of one-on-one conversations -- a great motivational tool. Leaders thrive when they strengthen relationships with their people by spending more one-on-one time with them to hear their suggestions, ideas, problems and issues as well as talking about performance issues and their work.
Find out what motivates them. Do you know what gets your team members out of bed in the morning? What they're passionate about -- their goals, aspirations, and interests? In other words, do you really know your team members? Great leaders show an interest in their people's jobs and career aspirations in order to motivate them the right way. Once that's been established, they look into the future to create learning and development opportunities for their people. They find out what motivates their best people by getting to know what desires will drive each team member. This is about emotional engagement.
Provide the resources they need to do their work exceptionally well. It's a simple question, but you'd be surprised how often it is not asked: What do you need right now to do your job better? You may be surprised, or even shocked at the answer; it could be that they need access to more information to make the right decisions, bettter equipment or even another work space. Acting on what you find out will be a huge motivational booster.
No one comes to work with the intent to do nothing and fail. It is that over time people get frustrated by their leadership, the lack of understanding and support.
Hence, leaders need to invite people to discussion, listen and understand what motivates each individual team member. You will find similarities and differences. Ask about there happy moments, their frustrations; their dislikes and likes. Ask them why they are around. Get their vision and mission. What they need to succeed.
The answers will provide input to your vision and implementation plan, to your inspiring narrative which makes the team move - the original meaning of the word motivating. Not through external energy and push but through the appeal of the joint undertaking and the removal of the barriers that often stop people to advance.
The best way to motivate your followers is to understand what motivates them. Take some time talking to them, understanding their values and goals. Then look to create an environment which caters to that.
As leaders our job is to motivate and lead people to achieve team goals.  In our experience, setting our teams up for success starts with understanding and communicating:  What’s In It For WE (WIIFW?)
When we motivate individuals, we engage the collective group to collaborate to work together towards common goals.
Establish Good Communication - Part of setting a clear goal is effective communication within your organization, but communication isn’t a one-way street. You should ensure that employees are in constant communication with each other, and this should be one of the most important elements of your communication and leadership strategy. This way, you can hear ideas, opinions, and feedback while keeping them informed about the tasks at hand. This can have a positive effect on your business, as it can resolve dilemmas in different ways. Make sure you are open and approachable in your attitude and communication and are available for them to get projects moving.
- Involve them/Align Teams
Ask them what it will take for them to get involved. Everyone is different, and what may be highly motivating for one person could be agony for someone else. Find out what motivates them and tailor your expectations accordingly.
Tell a story. Stories don’t tell people what to do. They engage people’s imaginations and emotions. They show people what they’re capable of becoming or of doing. Align on your purpose and values. This is the most important thing you can do in your business and the best way to motivate your employees. Know your purpose. Know your “why.” Why does your company exist? Then set defined values for your organization and ensure employees are not only aware of them, but live them out every single day. Values are a great way to keep everyone on the same page with expectations.
When there’s an immediate, short-term and specific goal that you want your people to achieve, you need to motivate them. When you want to shape people’s identity and their long-term aspirations and commitments, you need to inspire them.
There are 2 things that immediately come to mind: 1) Significant meaning and 2) Purposeful contribution. When people feel there is a definable meaning for what they are doing, and they embrace that meaning, they will work very hard. Add to this, they believe their contribution to the project is important and they will press thru to complete the project. Conversely, if its ‘just a job’ and they don’t think they are making a difference, you will have unmotivated people.
People are also motivated when they know the leader cares for them. If they feel like a tool the leaders uses to accomplish his/her goals, they will not work hard. However, if they feel the leader is genuinely concerned for their wellbeing, they will go into battle for the leader.
For teams to achieve collective objectives, people need to understand not just what to do but also, why and how it relates to their individual goals.  As leaders, when we think in terms of WE, we are able to motivate people in ways that are meaningful to them as individuals, because we are not only focused on the big picture goal but also the individual efforts we need to achieve that goal.
During challenging and uncertain times, motivating our teams is even more important.  But even as we are encountering challenges and uncertainty, there are key things that remain as motivating factors for people in the workplace.  At work, motivation is about understanding why people choose to work with us – we all have many career choices.  So why do people choose to work with some teams over others – As a leader, what do you offer that inspires people to choose to work with you rather than someone else? Individuals are motivated by different things – money, status, rewards, recognition – but what really motivates people is the opportunity to make important contributions. When working on a team, we are sharing our value to contribute to a goal.  Good leaders find ways to provide individuals the opportunity to speak up and share.  We can motivate people by making them feel encouraged to share their unique value to contribute to the collective goals.
Leading is achieving more together than we can alone.  Which is why motivation is so important.  Good leaders acknowledge individual and collective contributions as goals are met.  When leaders recognize the contributions of a team, it not only helps build motivation and momentum, but also builds connections between the efforts of the team and the goals of the organization (WIIFW – What’s In It For We?).  When individuals understand how their contributions have contributed to success, they build confidence in their abilities.  Sharing success is not only about recognizing achievements, but also about sharing that those achievements are accomplished through group efforts. Empowering your team to come to the table with new ideas, alternate approaches and unique suggestions will increase motivation and foster a more positive team culture.
The best kind of company is one where everyone works together, and employees feel integrated into the company and its processes in a certain way. This motivates them to achieve better results and makes them feel “integrated” into the companies and their processes. Supporting the alignment within your team promotes productivity, which can result in employees feeling valued, which further results in motivation. Encourage everyone to work together to achieve better results: encourage your team members, your employees, as well as your customers.
- Set clear goals/Share Your Goals
that are a little bit of a “stretch,” but are attainable based on the person’s skill set and experience. Goals that are too easy won’t push them to improve, but goals that are too hard may frustrate them and actually cause them to lose motivation. The right goals provide just the push they need to be their best selves.
Instead of setting large long-term goals for your team, set small, attainable, short-term goals for each individual employee that align to a larger mission objective. Going back to the importance of communication, make sure you’re communicating regularly with them to keep them on track. When they achieve their short-term goal, celebrate them in order to encourage this behavior in the future.
Set clear, measurable goals to articulate your vision so that your teams can track progress and see their success in a tangible way. To achieve this, you need to make sure that your employees are fully aware of the goals you ultimately pursue for your company. Employees usually get a deeper understanding of the task at hand if the management has a clear idea of why certain tasks need to be done to achieve the end goal.
You can only inspire and motivate a team if your team has an idea of the task they’re working on, but the question is, how does a leader inspire their team? Follow your SMART goals in terms of team motivation and strive to get the best out of each team member by being direct, specific, and clear. Establish good leadership by communicating with everyone in the team, setting up routine meetings with your teams, and being clear about your goals, and goals of the organization. Showing your team that you care about their goals is an effective way to build relationships and increase team motivation. As a leader, you should encourage your teams to combine their professional and personal goals with the goals of the organization.
Give Feedback - You can also motivate your team members to work hard and get the best out of them by giving constructive feedback. Motivate and encourage them to exceed your expectations. It’s great to find thoughtful ways to motivate a team, and it’s directly related to your company’s success. Effective employee check - we know exactly what team members do to achieve the overall goals, mission, and vision of the company with positive feedback. In theory, these reviews allow management to indicate how well employees are meeting expectations, achieving their goals, and contributing to the company’s success, in order to improve engagement and motivate employees to perform better. To promote the goal and achievement of the goals by team members, recurring employee checks - in, weekly or monthly - can be an effective motivator.
- Trust/Support them
Give them the autonomy to decide how the work will be done, within certain parameters. Give them ownership, but make sure they know you are available for questions.
The best managers delegate often and give their employees responsibility for delivering challenging work.
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the French aviator and author of “The Little Prince”, wrote, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” Sometimes you need to do both. You need to enlist and organize people to do a specific task-to build a ship according to specs, on time and on budget-and sometimes you need to activate people’s desires and stand aside. Who knows, you may be surprised by what they do.
- Appreciate/Reward them
Thank them sincerely. Praise publicly and share positive feedback with their supervisors, as well as with other teammates.
Provide tangible evidence of your gratitude. Send a handwritten note thanking them for the extra effort on a large project. Certificates, gift cards, plaques, public recognition, another interesting project, and more responsibility are all ways to reward people. Even if you have only a tiny budget, you can do something to show your gratitude.
Managers have to get into the habit of praising and complimenting their people for their good qualities and work. The companies in Gallup's study with the highest engagement levels use recognition and praise as a powerful motivator to get their commitment. They found that employees who receive it on a regular basis increase their individual productivity, receive higher loyalty and satisfaction scores from customers, and are more likely to stay with their organization.
Motivating others isn’t just about giving inspiring speeches or writing an amazing company vision statement. It’s about following up and providing the support people need to achieve their goals. It means providing the physical tools and programs they need to succeed, but also providing emotional support. Ask them how you can help. Let them know you’re there for them. And always follow up and keep them on track for success.
Give Recognition - Praising team members for their good work can have a huge impact on employee morale. Sometimes the power of positive praise is overlooked, but when employees achieve results, make extra effort or do an excellent job, praise them and tell them what you are grateful for. Don’t just say “good job” - don’t explain why it’s a good job or how it helps the company. Your team members see how they approach your company’s goals, not just the results of their work. Expressing gratitude is easy to implement almost immediately. What’s more is that they become an integral part of the company culture. However, other approaches might take time to properly implement and can result in some problems within the team if they feel overworked and demotivated as a result. You can make employees feel more responsible by continuing to grow their skills.  People want to know that their efforts are being appreciated, and sincere praise is a great success, especially when leaders publicly or privately acknowledge their achievements. You can see it in other positive moments, but wait until you have finished the project to show gratitude and pay tribute. It not only motivates your employees but also helps them to succeed in their future work. Reward your team for their hard work and commitment to your company’s goals, not just your own.
- Challenge them/Provide Opportunities for Growth
Start a friendly competition among teams or departments, ideally one in which everyone can win or learn something.
Help them develop new skills. actually giving them meaningful new skills or knowledge in other areas that they can use to leverage their natural strengths for future roles, whether with their current company or another company. The point is to serve and value them so exceptionally well as people and workers that they have no reason to leave but use their newfound skills for new projects.
Another thing you can do is to give them opportunities to learn and develop. Everyone wants to succeed and be good at something. If you understand which direction your followers want to grow in and give them those opportunities they will definitely feel motivated.
To motivate and inspire the team to achieve good results, employees should be equipped with growth and development opportunities. Empower your team to develop itself through on-site training and education. Provide your team and individuals with training and development opportunities that enable people to continuously improve and improve their skills. When individuals bring new skills to the team environment, it can lift everyone up and make a positive change in their work environment.
It can be difficult to get people excited about the journey to work, especially when the daily working environment is unpleasant. However, when teams learn something new together, it can help them connect and build new connections. These opportunities should be tailored to each individual employee and can be seen as challenging goals, such as inviting employees to shadow you or serve as a teacher or mentor in your own time. Encourage your team to set learning goals and focus on teaching them transferable skills that they could use for different positions.
Employees can come up with new ways to work together on problems, build stronger bonds that serve to improve the overall morale of the team, and of course, develop new skills that can be used to improve their performance on future projects. Challenges help your team grow as individuals and as a team, so give people the chance to do something different from going to work as always. A challenge, such as meeting a deadline, can help recharge teams that feel bogged down in playing day-to-day.
People are always excited to learn new things and develop new skills. This is especially true when said skills help them perform better at their jobs. Make sure your goals are both achievable and realistic. This ensures that their experience of working in the team is motivating – not discouraging.
Showing your team how a particular set of skills leads to business results is an excellent way to encourage the development of new skills such as teamwork and communication skills.  
You can also help motivate your team by responding positively to the skills and abilities that members bring to a team. Motivational leaders, for example, help build trust and can encourage team members to move toward goals and achieve common goals. It can be a great way to inspire and motivate people without using emotional tactics, as people respond to intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.

- being end-to-end
I found this worrying. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.
IMHO, I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end. Here, I’ll discuss the benefits and counter-arguments, how to become end-to-end, and the experiences of Stitch Fix amakend Netflix. An end-to-end data scientist can identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:
What is the problem? Why is it important?
Can we solve it? How should we solve it?
What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?
For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact.
Working end-to-end provides increased context. While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions. The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk
It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem.
Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:
Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it
Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app
By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.
Iteration and learning rate is increased. With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.
- Communication and coordination:
Communication and coordination overhead is reduced. With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it. What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.
The DE and DS need to communicate on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.
It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.
While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.
(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)
But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate.
- multiple roles
Iteration and learning rate is increased. With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.
There’s greater ownership and accountability. Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.
If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.
Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.
Diffusion of responsibility: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation.
Social loafing: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.
- For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction, which is closely tied to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
Autonomy: By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.
Mastery: In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.
Purpose: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of purpose.
- specialist experts
Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:
Wanting to specialize in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: GPT-3 primer). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.
No one achieves greatness by becoming a generalist. You don’t hone a skill by diluting your attention to its development. The only way to get to the next level is focus. – John C. Maxwell
Lack of interest. Not everyone is keen to engage with customers and business to define the problem, gather requirements, and write design documents. Likewise, not everyone is interested in software engineering, production code, unit tests, and CI/CD pipelines.
Others have also made arguments for why data scientists should specialize (and not be end-to-end).


14. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment and why this achievement is significant to you.
`proudest achievement`, `conflict`

15. Tell me about your greatest professional failure and how you recovered.
`failure`
Allocate tasks to team members in parallel to avoid blockers. Set up reasonable deadline as use advantages of everyone.

• Know yourself: Take the time to review your own resume as your interviewer will almost certainly ask about key events in your work history.
• Motivation and collaboration: Different interviewers will ask different questions, typically seeking two signals in particular:
    • Motivation: What’s your motivation? Why do you want to work at Facebook? Why are you working as a software engineer?
    • Collaboration: How do you collaborate with peers? How do you resolve conflicts?

• Have concrete examples or anecdotes: Support each question with examples. Some typical behavioral interview questions are:
    • What were some of the best things you’ve built?
    • What are you proud of?
    • What could you have done better?
    • What were some successful collaborations you’ve had?
    • Tell me about a time when you advocated for and pushed your own ideas forward despite opposition?
    • How do you deal with conflict?
    • How do you like to give and receive feedback?
    • What kinds of technologies are you most excited about?
    • Why Facebook?
