## Behavior Questions Answer
STAR method to construct the response:
- `Situation`: Start off your response to the interview question by explaining what the ‘situation’ was and who was involved.
  - What was the context/background for the situation you were in?
  - Where did it occur, when did it happen?
  - What was the goal?
- `Task`: Once you have detailed the situation, explain what the ‘task’ was, or what needed to be done.
  - What was your role?
  - What were you trying to achieve? Why was it important?
  - What were the risks/consequences if nothing happened?
- `Action`: Now explain what ‘action’ you took, and what action others took. Also explain why you took this particular course of action.
  - What did you personally own?
  - How did you do it? How did you influence the outcome? Who else was involved?
  - What was the most significant obstacle you faced?
- `Result`: Explain to the panel what you would do differently if the same situation arose again. It is good to be reflective at the end of your responses. This demonstrates a level of maturity and it will also show the panel that you are willing to learn from every experience.
  - How did you measure success for this project?
  - What results did you achieve? (e.g., metrics)
  - What trade-offs did you have to make to achieve this?
  - What did you learn or would have done differently?

如果google l4和l5， meta e4 和e5.google
我想请问，同样一道bq题， 我应该着重于什么。假设我面的是senior职位。
比如how you handle conflicts with others。
如果是面e4， 我可以说和同事有技术点的争论， xxxx, 最后我说服了对方
如果是面e5， 我是不是说上面这种就挂了，我得说， 我带了一个项目，和别的cross function team argue， xxxx, 最后我赢了， 给team争得了话语权？也就是说，面senior一定要强调leadership和large scope，这样我才能过？
请大佬指点1， 2
如果我在一个问题里尽可能的多说几点？是不是容易踩中，这个方法有什么不好的地方吗？ 比如conflicts with others， 我先提design时候有技术conflicts(Backbone; Disagree and Commit), 然后定plan时候manager希望快，我觉得需要写足够的test cases(Insist on the Highest Standards), 然后deployed的时候，infra team希望用较少的server( save cost)， 我强调需要多加resource, 因为增长会很快  (think for future)


这个问题不光是一个面试题，是真的再测试你怎么处理工作事情，测试你在工作中的行为准则。
所谓退一步海阔天空，我在回答问题之前，先退一步反抛出问题：为什么工作中会有conflict？
然后回答自己抛出的问题：因为我和同事都care， 我们都希望把工作做好。如果我对手头的工作不care的话，我什么事情都能：好好好，做个老好人，对不对？这么一来，我就和同事build了同样的基础点。既然我们high level的目标相同，都想把事情做好，只是具体怎么执行出现了分歧，那这就不是一个大问题。那回答到这步其实我的答案就很简单的推进下去了：communication。可以通过不同程度的communication和同事一起坐下来讨论不同方案的pro和con，从requirement出发来评定各自的好处，最终一起决定一个大家都满意的方案去执行。
你看，这样是谁说服谁根本不重要，把一个conflict的问题变成了一个teamwork和management的问题。
当然，这不光是我的回答，具体工作中我也是这么做的。
e.g.，如果是金字塔式的企业，回答可以偏重“只要团队利益这个大前提不受到损害就愿意在conflict中做出一定的妥协（一般面试官不会追问具体是多大程度的妥协这种低级问题）”；如果是比较egalitarian的企业，可以适当地增加“stand my groud”的权重。
BQ的目的就是考察除了硬实力、候选人是否有能力融入到即将加入的团队中高效高质量地完成团队目标。不同的企业有不同的核心价值，这个是可以在官网上查到的，就算部门团队执行起来是另一套，但是面试回答BQ的时候只要能尽量往核心价值上靠，是肯定不会吃亏的。

conflict之类的问题，以前的话，我可能也会和你一样，想办法去说服别人…….1point3acres
现在的话，我会想着了解xfn的痛点和反对的原因，把他们列出来，然后一起通过几轮的design review合作想出一些解决方案。如果涉及到的东西很大很广，就include更高级别的ic来寻求建议

behavioral questions本质上就是考察你是不是一个别人愿意和你一起共事的人  所以展现领导力合作能力和共情力等情商技能很重要
handle conflicts这种问题回答的重点在如何让对方在对你不生气的情况下解决冲突

1. 避免争端。 2. 增加communication。 3. 听取领导意见。 4. 向领导学习成功经验。  这题答案就不收你米了。

0.忠言逆耳说在前头：从楼主的这几句问题概述，是能看出楼主对于BQ毫无经验……以下由浅到深分享一些方法论，希望楼主细读下去，然后写逐字稿，交给ChatGPT润色，再对着镜子逐字背，做到当面问答的时候整段整段的活都在脑子里，不要现想。.
1.BQ跟简历一样，描述做了什么只是媒介，目的是证明你是一个有价值的人，是一个有各种优点的好员工。BQ也是一样，你要读到每道题的题眼，即对方希望你讲一个什么例子、来证明你具有哪个品质。
2.就拿经典题conflicts with others来说，楼主觉得题眼是什么呢？你提及的e4/5/6 level之别，抑或你说服了对方/争得了话语权云云，真的是对方想听的么？
这道题背后的“品质”可以有好几个方向，我先随手列一些：
2.1一个tech任务，我觉得该做，同事觉得没必要，我调研/presentation/最后组会上说服team做了，事后deploy了也证明成功——我有big picture，并且launch project linked with actions
2.2一个tech任务，我觉得不该做但组里坚持做，我表达了反对意见但坚决执行了——backbone, disagree and commit
2.3一个tech任务，同事急于求成，但feature可能有compromise，我没同意，坚决保持design完整性和code quality——insist on highest standard
2.4一个tech任务，我强调时间紧，必须缩紧scope保证commitment，但同事非说要做完善——delivery result, speed matters
2.5一个新加的需求，同事马上准备coding但我push back——manage with standardization; 做活儿要有优先级和方法论. 1point3acres.com
2.6新需求但是是customer/stake holder提的，同事想push back但我坚持必须立刻shifting demand——customer obsession
2.7一个活儿同事觉得做完了，但我认为没做完——我预先看到很多potential concern没解决，我要dive deep. ----
2.8一个活儿同事觉得做完了，但我认为没做完——在pass to QA前还有很多dev能做的，比如补足data metrics或者增加event tracking方便发布后验证其效果；refactor to test-driven code或者加上unit test……总之，take the ownership of your code，而非做完就交，啥也不想
（先写这么多）
3.楼主是不是觉得我跑题了？我为什么一字不提“到底是谁convince了谁”？因为这道题到现在都只有一半信息，我们并不知道另一半的题干，于是无从作答。
我举一个生活中的例子，相亲（注意不是恋爱，不是双向选择；就是单纯的相亲，就是如何在一问一答间说出对方期待的答案）。假如对方问你生活中有什么兴趣，怎么答？——假如对方期待的是“宅在家里的兴趣”，你说越多旅行/郊游/往外走的兴趣，red flag越多。假如对方期待的是“开发共同兴趣”，你说越多对方不感冒的兴趣，red flag越多。甚至假如对方期待的是“踏实顾家”，那你说越多兴趣，你red flag就越多。所以答案是“不能答”，我们要先探一探对面的需求。
比如，我会先说，我喜欢读书，也喜欢打游戏，你想先听我一本正经的、还是嬉戏玩耍的？或者，我平时工作很忙，周末也要花一些时间看tech blog/自我学习，然后另一半时间做我的兴趣，你刚才说的生活中的时间分配是前一类，更和我正业/职业相关的？还是后一类，完全是生活中如何放松自己愉悦自己的？
所以楼主现在开窍了么？conflicts with others应该怎么回答？——别答呀，此刻这只是半道题，另一半题干需要你“communication”呀。我通常会反问面试官，您的问题指的是technical方面，我和其他engineer有conflict的情景吗？还是我和product或者manager有conflict的情景？
那对方很可能会说，我都在问，你都可以说，以上都包括。
那我就会接着说，好的，那我来说两个例子吧，一个和同事的，更technical一点；一个和manager的，更business view/long-term value/big picture一点。然后我随着答，会随着挑选上面的踩分点，根据对方的即时反馈/插话追问/deep dive，来调整我下一段怎么选择。比如我第一段儿强调一个conflict重要的是technical如何取舍，说了30s感觉对方无感，那就说明踩分点错了，下一段我就会掉头，说争论只是过程，重点在于deliver the result赶紧出活儿。又或者前一段说speed matters应该赶紧发布，对方无感，我下一段就“补充”说这个活儿我是如何长期维护、长期更新、扩大scalability等等。就是准备好招数，前一招没破防，下一招就要变招。这是两个人沟通的过程，你要积极接收对面的信息。出口的所有的话都是半试探，半前进，且随时给自己留保存点，该读档的时候要读档，不能一句话把自己堵死。
4.回到conflict，咱们说谁convince了谁更合适？——先说一个你technical、convince别人的，选insist on highest standard, 或者deliver the result这种打击面最广的AOE，先试试，看对面反应。面试官的题板上大多会有他想考察你的key value的。我按照上文抛出第一段儿后，通常面试官听完后会说挺好的，但我也想听听你有没有被别人convince的经历？我第二段就会说一个我被manager convince的经历，主题大概是我有很好的technical perspective，但engineering lifecycle是一个多元的、合作的事情，manager教会了我CI/CD的知识——what have you learned from XXX / if 某活儿 you can do it again, how will you improve your solution or strategy，这都是经典的这道题的后半题题干。.--
5.以上是“简单句”，咱们有余力，可以再尝试一下“复合句”。如何处理conflict的这道题，我把我常用的例子写给你：
曾经有一次，有一个需要前端和后端合力完成的活儿。后端先做完了，wrap up，code freeze，送给QA测试了。但最后一刻发现还有个feature竟然遗漏了，于是甩给我移动端来做（我是iOS dev）。这个feature是要look into a http request, do interpretation, etc.，这是一个极度违反mobile end设计理念的（我们不对raw data做这么复杂且hacky的transformation），我本不同意（出现矛盾）；但delivery date在眼前，后端已经没时间重写重测了。于是我是这么解决这个矛盾的：1.首先我答应我会做，因为这个feature直接授意于stake holder，deliver result重于implementation环节上的龃龉。2.我会把code写得test-driven，decoupling做好，多做一层abstraction，这次发布用hacky实现类，之后版本更正回来（面试官tech background深我就多说，否则就少说；前边我在描述事件的时候看对方需要多少clarification就可以判断出来）。3.我在写完代码后，也额外补了一些data metrics，方便debug；也在ticket里注明了QA acceptable criteria，方便测试（take ownership，team cooperation，big picture都是可选方向，看对方更想听哪个）。4.我在deploy之前喊了tech lead，back-end developer，以及PM开了个会，我严肃声明这是一个非常compromising的实现，这是一个不该出现在前端的代码，我们必须在之后的版本中移除去后端（communication，notify in advance and sync on the same page, long-term value, highest standard of the code quality自选方向）。5.最后deploy了，说一下结果圆满，发布按时。以及之后的retrospective上，我把这件事做了复盘，并严格执行了这段代码从前端移除去后端的实施。short-term和long-term兼顾了。code quality和delivery也兼顾了（有矛盾，但重要的是完成任务。有分歧，但重要的是成员合作）。当然也不要说得尽善尽美，面试官假如问如果再来一次你有什么可以改进的，我会说tech角度我们的代码应该在abstraction上再加强一些，Dependency injection多用一些，下次万一不得已又要加hacky东西，不用先做refactor。非tech角度，我会说我思考如何使流程更成熟，而不是每次都依靠临场应变。
BQ题到最后就是复合句的写作。跟写代码一样，不要长算式，而是一个function就return一个值，unit test coverage查一查这些中间变量，有不对的赶紧停，变招，再call再试。多线程，多async call。别只顾自说自话，别只有output没有input。如果没有constraint先问constraint，如果题目太ambiguous我们就自己先来缩小scope，等等等等。
掌握了这些，每轮最后“你有什么问题问我么”，其实也都是很好的交流点，可以反问一些BQ问题的。比如对面是hiring manager，我就常问假如我是你的队员，你最看重的value是什么？你希望我更backbone一点、还是implement the delegated task更要紧？比如对面是tech lead，我也会问你希望我在high-level design多花心思，还是implementation时更注重test-driven code多花心思？……面试毕竟是双向选择，我问这些的时候，也是真想知道这个组的现有组员都是怎么做活儿的。楼主也可以反问环节问一些BQ问题，你通过设计这些问题，也会逐渐理解别人问你的时候，他想探求的是你的哪方面品质的有无。



`Example`:
- First, I created a customer feedback mechanism on a weekly basis.
- Second, I wanted to make sure our users knew the why behind this change, and I took the action of creating a monthly office hours and 12 continued education sessions on the product. In fact, these sessions are now being used as standard practice for all future implementations, which there have been three of this size so far.
- And third, a byproduct of the customer feedback actually revealed insights to other opportunities in their organization. I deliver these insights to the executive board in a thorough report, and they were delighted to hear the strengths and opportunities of their organization.
As a result, the implementation was delivered with a customer feedback score of 9.5 out of 10, and that's the highest our company has ever seen. The insights report opened another avenue of business with the customer that doubled our revenue.
Here, and throughout this example, notice how I'm using quantifiable data to show the scale of my impact.

## 16 Leadership Principles
- `1. CUSTOMER OBSESSION`: Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.
In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I worked closely with a key client who was implementing a new AI-driven recommendation system. `The client was unfamiliar with machine learning technologies and had concerns about how the system would integrate with their existing infrastructure. The process was challenging because it required both technical guidance and clear communication to ensure the client was comfortable with the transition.`

`My responsibility was to guide the client through the implementation process, address their concerns, and ensure that the system was deployed successfully.` It was crucial to make the process as smooth as possible, as the client’s business depended on the timely and effective integration of this new technology.

`I began by conducting a series of workshops with the client’s team to explain the technology, its benefits, and how it would integrate with their existing systems. I created detailed documentation and provided hands-on demonstrations to demystify the process and build their confidence.` As we moved forward, I maintained regular communication with the client, providing updates and addressing any concerns in real-time. When technical challenges arose, such as compatibility issues with their infrastructure, I worked closely with their IT department to develop customized solutions, ensuring minimal disruption to their operations. `To further ease their transition, I offered additional training sessions post-implementation, ensuring that their team was fully equipped to manage and optimize the system moving forward.`

`Thanks to the comprehensive support and tailored approach, the implementation was completed successfully and within the agreed timeline. The client was able to integrate the AI-driven system seamlessly into their operations, resulting in a 25% increase in user engagement within the first quarter of use. The client expressed their appreciation for the guidance and support provided, and this led to a stronger, ongoing partnership between our companies.`

`This experience reinforced the importance of empathy, clear communication, and proactive problem-solving in delivering exceptional customer service. By focusing on the customer’s needs and concerns, I was able to help them navigate a complex process and achieve their goals. It also reminded me that earning and maintaining trust is key to building long-term, successful relationships with clients.`

- `2. OWNERSHIP`: Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.
`Call Center use case`
In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was working on a project to improve the accuracy of a predictive model used in forecasting demand for a major retail client. `The existing model was performing adequately, but I believed that implementing a more complex, state-of-the-art algorithm could significantly boost accuracy. Although the timeline was tight, I decided to take the risk and pushed for the adoption of this new approach.`
My responsibility was to deliver an improved model that could provide more accurate forecasts, which would have a direct impact on the client’s inventory management and sales strategy. The risk was that if the new algorithm didn’t perform as expected or took too long to implement, we could miss the project deadline, impacting the client’s operations.
I proceeded by implementing the new algorithm, investing significant time in tuning and testing it. However, as the project progressed, it became clear that the new algorithm was more complex than anticipated, requiring additional data preprocessing and computational resources. Despite my best efforts, the model's performance gains were marginal compared to the original approach, and the implementation took longer than expected,`pushing us close to the deadline`.
Unfortunately, the new model did not deliver the significant improvements I had hoped for, and the time spent on it led to delays. We were able to meet the deadline, but only after reverting to the original model and making minor adjustments. `The client was satisfied with the final delivery, but the effort to implement the new algorithm ended up being an unnecessary detour that added stress to the project.`
This experience taught me the importance of balancing innovation with practicality, especially under tight deadlines. While I believe in the value of taking calculated risks to drive improvement, I’ve learned to better assess the feasibility and potential impact of such decisions, particularly when working within constrained timelines. In future projects, I’ve taken a more incremental approach to introducing new methodologies, ensuring that they are well-aligned with project goals and timelines before fully committing to them.

`Good example for Ownership`
In one of my projects, I was tasked with improving the performance of a recommendation system for a large-scale e-commerce platform. `After thorough research, I proposed a complex neural network model with advanced embedding layers. The model demonstrated excellent performance in offline testing, significantly improving accuracy compared to the existing system. However, the model was large and required substantial computational resources, which made integration with the existing platform challenging.`
My responsibility was to deliver a recommendation model that could be deployed seamlessly on the client’s platform. `The new model promised to drive better recommendations and user engagement, but the risk was its complexity. The platform's infrastructure wasn't designed to handle such a resource-intensive model, and there was a possibility that it wouldn’t be compatible without significant re-engineering.`
I collaborated with the client’s IT team to explore ways to integrate the new model into their existing platform. We attempted to optimize the model by reducing its size and experimenting with different deployment strategies. I also proposed modifications to the platform’s infrastructure to accommodate the model. Despite these efforts, the model's requirements exceeded what the platform could support without substantial and costly changes.
Ultimately, we were unable to integrate the model into the platform without causing significant disruptions to the existing system. The client was not in a position to invest in the necessary infrastructure upgrades, so we had to abandon the new model. Instead, we reverted to the previous system with minor enhancements. Although the performance gains from the new model were impressive in a controlled environment, the failure to integrate it cost us valuable time and resources.
`This experience underscored the importance of considering not just model performance but also operational feasibility when proposing new solutions. While innovation is critical, it must be balanced with practical considerations, especially in environments with existing infrastructure constraints. In the future, I’ve been more diligent in evaluating the trade-offs between model complexity and deployability, ensuring that any proposed solution aligns with the client’s technical capabilities and business goals.`
- `3. INVENT AND SIMPLIFY`: Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.
`Call Center use case`
In my previous role, I was part of a team tasked with improving the quality of customer service at a large contact center. We noticed that while most agents were performing well, there were inconsistencies in how they handled customer interactions. This inconsistency led to varying levels of customer satisfaction. `To address this, we decided to develop an NLP-based system that could monitor conversations between agents and customers in real-time, identify areas for improvement, and provide actionable insights for coaching.`

My role was to lead the development of the NLP algorithms that would analyze these conversations. The main objective was to create a system that could automatically assess the quality of interactions, detect issues such as improper tone, missed opportunities to upsell, or non-compliance with protocols, and generate personalized coaching suggestions for agents.

We began by collecting a large dataset of recorded conversations, which we labeled for various quality indicators, such as sentiment, compliance, and customer satisfaction. `I led the development of a multi-layered NLP model that combined sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition (NER) to evaluate each interaction.`
Sentiment analysis was used to gauge the emotional tone of conversations, while topic modeling helped identify key discussion points, such as complaints or queries. We also incorporated speech-to-text processing to handle voice interactions, ensuring that the system could work with both text and voice data.
`We integrated this model into a real-time monitoring system, allowing managers to receive immediate feedback on agent performance. The system also provided tailored coaching recommendations based on specific areas where an agent might need improvement`, such as using a more empathetic tone or adhering to the script more closely.

The implementation of the NLP system had a significant positive impact. Within the first three months, `we saw a 15% improvement in customer satisfaction scores and a 20% reduction in escalated calls. Agents who received targeted coaching based on the system’s recommendations showed noticeable improvement in their interaction quality. The system also empowered managers by providing them with data-driven insights, allowing for more effective and personalized coaching sessions.`

This project underscored the power of NLP in transforming customer service operations. It taught me the importance of creating models that not only analyze data but also deliver actionable insights in a user-friendly manner. Moving forward, I’ve applied these lessons to other projects, ensuring that the focus is always on generating tangible benefits for both the business and the end-users.
- `4. ARE RIGHT, A LOT`: Tell me about a time when you observed two business opportunities to improve ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected.
`Call Center use case`
At a previous company where I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer, we were facing challenges in both customer retention and operational efficiency. Customer churn was higher than expected, and operational costs were increasing due to inefficient processes in our customer service department. `I identified two potential opportunities to address these issues: first, to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, and second, to optimize the customer service workflow using automation to reduce response times and errors.`

My role involved analyzing data to uncover patterns that could lead to improved business outcomes. While working on separate projects—one focusing on customer behavior analysis and the other on process optimization—I noticed a pattern. Many of the customers who churned had previously experienced slow or unsatisfactory responses from customer service. This insight led me to realize that by improving our operational efficiency, we could also enhance the customer experience, thereby addressing both issues simultaneously.

To validate the connection, I conducted a deep analysis of customer service interaction data, cross-referencing it with churn rates. The data confirmed that poor service experiences were a significant predictor of churn. I proposed a solution that integrated both opportunities: developing a machine learning model to predict churn and simultaneously implementing process automation to streamline customer service operations. I collaborated with the data science team to build the predictive model and with the IT team to deploy a chatbot for handling routine inquiries, `freeing up human agents for more complex issues`.

`By connecting these two opportunities, we achieved a 25% reduction in customer churn within six months and lowered operational costs by 15% due to the increased efficiency of our customer service department.` The predictive model allowed us to proactively engage with at-risk customers, while the automation improved overall service quality and speed. This dual approach not only improved customer satisfaction but also significantly enhanced our ROI by increasing revenue retention and reducing costs.

This experience taught me the value of looking beyond isolated business problems and instead considering how different aspects of operations might be interconnected. By taking a holistic approach, I was able to implement a solution that addressed multiple challenges simultaneously, leading to greater overall impact. Moving forward, I’ve applied this mindset to other projects, always seeking to identify synergies that can drive greater business value.
- `5. LEARN AND BE CURIOUS`: How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?

- `6. HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST`: Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.
In one of my previous roles as a lead on a data science team, we were working on a critical project that involved developing a recommendation system for a key client. `One of the team members, who was responsible for data preprocessing and feature engineering, was consistently missing deadlines and delivering work that didn’t meet the required standards. This was causing delays in the overall project timeline and affecting the team’s morale.`

`As the team lead, it was my responsibility to ensure that everyone was contributing effectively and that the project stayed on track. My goal was to address the performance issues with the team member in a way that would help them improve while also safeguarding the project’s success.`

I started by having a `one-on-one conversation with the team member to understand the root causes of their poor performance`. I approached the discussion with empathy, asking open-ended questions to get a sense of whether they were facing any challenges, either professionally or personally, that were affecting their work. It turned out that they were `struggling with a lack of clarity around their tasks` and were unsure about how to implement certain data processing techniques.
To address this, `I provided additional guidance and resources, including documentation and tutorials, to help them get up to speed`. I also `paired them with a more experienced team member for a few weeks to provide mentorship and hands-on support`. Additionally, we `set up a more structured check-in process` where I could monitor their progress more closely and provide feedback in real-time.

After implementing these measures, I saw a marked improvement in the team member’s performance. `They began meeting deadlines and their work quality improved significantly`. The mentorship they received also helped them build confidence in their abilities. As a result, the project was able to get back on track, and we successfully delivered the recommendation system to the client on time. `The entire team’s morale improved as well, knowing that we were all working together to achieve our goals.`

This experience taught me the importance of addressing performance issues early and with empathy. It reinforced the value of understanding the underlying causes of poor performance and providing the necessary support to help team members succeed. `Since then, I’ve always made it a point to maintain open communication with my team, offer timely feedback, and ensure that everyone has the resources they need to perform at their best.`
- `7. INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS`: Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.
During a critical project at my previous company, we were developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn. This was a key initiative because retaining customers was a top priority for the business. Midway through the project, we encountered significant challenges with the model’s accuracy. `Despite multiple iterations, the model’s performance was not meeting the required threshold. We had already invested a considerable amount of time, and there was pressure to either deliver the project as it was or move on to other priorities.`

As the lead data scientist on the project, I was responsible for ensuring that the model was not only functional but also delivered meaningful insights that the business could act on. Despite the setbacks, I was determined to improve the model’s accuracy to meet our business objectives and provide real value to the company.

Rather than settling for a suboptimal model, I decided to dig deeper into the data and the modeling approach. I spent extra hours re-examining the data for potential issues, such as data quality and feature selection. I also experimented with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques that we hadn’t initially considered. `Additionally, I reached out to a colleague who had experience with similar models in a different industry to get a fresh perspective.`
After several more rounds of testing and refining, I discovered that the model’s poor performance was due to an imbalance in the training data. I implemented techniques to balance the dataset and fine-tuned the model, which resulted in a significant improvement in accuracy.

By persisting and continuing to refine the model, we were able to achieve an accuracy rate that exceeded the original target by 15%. This allowed the company to effectively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies, which ultimately led to a 20% reduction in churn over the following quarter. The success of this project also set a new standard for data-driven decision-making within the organization, and `it became a template for future predictive modeling efforts`.

This experience reinforced the importance of persistence and a thorough, methodical approach to problem-solving. `It showed me that even when a solution seems out of reach, continuing to explore different angles and seeking input from others can lead to breakthroughs.` Since then, I’ve always been willing to go the extra mile when I believe that there’s more value to be uncovered, and this mindset has helped me deliver high-quality results in subsequent projects.
- `8. THINK BIG`: Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.
`Tool and standard procedure which could be used by more teams.`

- `9. BIAS FOR ACTION`: Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you.
In a situation where three people are waiting for help, `my first step would be to quickly assess the nature and urgency of each request`. `I would ask each person for a brief overview of their needs, allowing me to identify which tasks are time-sensitive or have the most significant impact on the project or team. For instance, if one request is blocking a key deliverable and the other two are less urgent, I would prioritize the critical task first.`

Once I’ve assessed the urgency, I would communicate my plan to all three individuals to ensure they understand the order in which I’ll address their requests. I might say something like, ‘I’m going to help Person A first because their task is urgent and affecting the deadline. After that, I’ll assist Person B and then Person C. I appreciate your patience and will get to each of you as quickly as possible.’ Clear communication helps manage expectations and reduces any potential frustration.

To handle the tasks efficiently, I would focus on completing each one as effectively as possible, without compromising on quality. `If the tasks are complex or time-consuming, I might break them down into smaller steps and handle the most critical aspects first, possibly delegating some parts if appropriate.` I would also use any available tools or resources to expedite the process, such as leveraging templates, automation, or seeking quick input from colleagues.

After addressing each request, `I would follow up with each person to ensure that their needs were fully met and that there are no further issues`. This follow-up is crucial to confirm that the solutions provided were effective and that everyone is satisfied with the outcome. `If any additional support is needed, I’d make sure to address it promptly`.

After the situation is resolved, I would take a moment to reflect on how it was handled, considering what went well and where there might be room for improvement. `If similar situations occur frequently, I might look for ways to streamline processes or set up better systems for handling multiple requests at once, ensuring that I’m even more efficient the next time around.`
- `10. FRUGALITY`: Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.
`Automate workflow. Reduce the cost in cloud.`
In my previous role as a machine learning engineer at a mid-sized tech company, we were developing a series of machine learning models to support various business functions, including customer segmentation and demand forecasting. `While the models were performing well, the costs associated with the computational resources—specifically cloud computing and storage—were growing rapidly. The increase in costs was becoming a concern for the team, especially as we anticipated scaling up these models for broader use across the company.`

As part of the team responsible for these models, I took it upon myself to `explore ways to optimize our use of cloud resources and reduce costs without compromising the performance or accuracy of the models`. `My goal was to identify inefficiencies in our current setup and propose solutions that could lead to significant cost savings`.

I began by conducting a thorough analysis of our cloud usage patterns, including computation time, data storage, and the frequency of model training and inference. I noticed that we were often retraining models on full datasets even when only a small portion of the data had changed, leading to unnecessary compute costs.
To address this, I proposed and implemented a strategy to use incremental learning techniques, which allowed us to update our models with new data without having to retrain them from scratch. This `significantly reduced the computation time required for training`.
Additionally, `I identified that we were storing large volumes of intermediate data that were not being used frequently`. I recommended a policy to regularly archive or delete unnecessary data and switch to a more cost-efficient storage tier for older, less frequently accessed data.

As a result of these changes, we were able to `reduce our cloud computing costs by approximately 30% over the next quarter`, which translated into tens of thousands of dollars in savings. The incremental learning approach not only saved money but also sped up our model deployment cycles, allowing the team to iterate more quickly on new features. These cost savings were reinvested into further R&D efforts, enabling us to explore additional machine learning projects that were previously outside our budget.

`This experience taught me the importance of continuously evaluating and optimizing the resources we use, particularly in high-cost areas like cloud computing.` It also reinforced the value of staying proactive in identifying inefficiencies. `Since then, I’ve made it a habit to regularly review and question our processes and expenditures, always looking for innovative ways to maximize value while minimizing costs.`

"Our goal was to enhance the recommendation system to deliver personalized content even for new users, improving their initial experience with the platform. Traditional collaborative filtering methods were not effective in this scenario due to the lack of user data, and the team was struggling to find a solution."

"Recognizing the limitations of traditional approaches, I proposed an innovative solution by leveraging transfer learning and cross-domain data. I suggested using data from other similar platforms where users had shared preferences, which could be applied to our new users.
To implement this, I developed a model that could transfer knowledge from a pre-trained recommendation system on a similar platform and fine-tune it using the minimal data available from new users on our platform. I also incorporated content-based filtering techniques, using metadata from the content itself, such as genres and keywords, to provide more accurate recommendations.
This hybrid approach was unexpected because it combined different methodologies and external data sources, which was a departure from our usual practice of relying solely on internal data."

"The implementation of this innovative solution significantly improved the recommendation accuracy for new users. The personalized content delivery for first-time users increased by 25%, leading to higher user engagement and retention in the critical initial stages.
The approach was not only successful but also sparked new discussions within the team about leveraging external data and transfer learning for other use cases. The solution became a standard part of our recommendation system for new users, and I was recognized for my creative problem-solving."

"This experience taught me the value of thinking outside the box and exploring unconventional methods to solve complex problems. It reinforced the importance of staying open to new ideas and cross-disciplinary approaches. Since then, I’ve continued to apply innovative thinking to my work, looking for opportunities to combine different techniques and data sources to achieve the best results."

### ??? Question 37: "Tell me about a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem." (Invent and Simplify)
"In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with improving the accuracy of a predictive maintenance model for industrial machinery. The existing model was overly complicated, with numerous features and parameters that made it difficult to maintain and interpret. Additionally, the model’s performance was not meeting the desired accuracy levels, and the complexity made it challenging to optimize."

"My goal was to enhance the model’s performance while simplifying its structure to make it easier to maintain and optimize. The challenge was to identify the key factors contributing to the model's performance and eliminate unnecessary complexity without sacrificing accuracy."

"I began by conducting a thorough analysis of the existing model to identify which features and parameters were contributing most to its performance. Through this analysis, I discovered that many of the features were redundant or provided little value to the model’s predictive power.
To simplify the model, I decided to focus on a few high-impact features that were strongly correlated with the machinery's failure patterns. I removed unnecessary features and reduced the number of parameters, streamlining the model’s architecture. Additionally, I replaced the complex ensemble method with a simpler, yet highly effective, decision tree-based approach that was easier to interpret and tune.
I also automated the feature selection process, allowing the model to dynamically adjust to the most relevant features over time, further simplifying the maintenance process."

"The simplified model not only improved in accuracy by 10% but also became much easier to maintain and update. The reduction in complexity led to faster training times and quicker deployment, allowing the maintenance team to react more swiftly to potential issues.
The streamlined approach also made it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand and trust the model’s predictions, leading to broader adoption across the organization. My work on simplifying the model was recognized as a key contribution to the project’s success and was later applied to other predictive models within the company."

"This experience reinforced the value of simplifying complex problems to achieve better results. I learned that sometimes, less is more, and that focusing on the essentials can lead to more robust and maintainable solutions. This approach has become a core part of my problem-solving strategy, helping me to deliver effective solutions while reducing unnecessary complexity."

`I was in a meeting in my team where the visualizations and plots of different deep learning models for the project were discussed by the team members. Although the model visualization plots look intuitive, there are concerns that the plots are not so good due to the formats are not unified, and everyone needs to put extra time to write their own code to produce the visualization figures. After the meeting, I decided to try and find a solution to this problem. I checked the source code and met up with the individual team members, and it is apparent that they are using different ways to visualize the model outputs and are not familiar with other tools. After some investigation work, I write code to adopt a visualization API to our source code from an open-source tool and provide a standard for the plots. From that day on, the members could easily call the API to output unified visualization plots and do not need to write their own code. It makes the visualizations more intuitive and standard and saves them a lot of time.`

### ??? Question 38: "Describe a situation when you had to work with incomplete data or information." (Are Right, A Lot)
"As a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with developing a demand forecasting model for a retail company. The challenge arose when I discovered that the historical sales data provided was incomplete, missing several key time periods and demographic details. This made it difficult to accurately predict future demand."

"This experience reinforced the importance of being resourceful and using sound judgment when faced with incomplete information. It taught me to be proactive in seeking out additional data sources and to always validate my assumptions. Moving forward, I’ve become more confident in my ability to make informed decisions, even in uncertain situations, and I’ve continued to prioritize transparency and communication when dealing with similar challenges."

`I was working on a project during one of my previous internships, and the project required me to work closely with another member in other teams. We have been working very well together, and we have different skills and strengths which move the project forward nicely. However, towards the end of the project, my manager says that the team member has to leave for a while due to a home emergency, and I need to finish the rest on my own. The only way for me to finish the project was to use the limited information I had available, which was passed to me before he left. To make sure I could finish the project, I took lots of research to figure out how to complete the other part of the project my collaborators used to be responsible for. I take an online course to learn new skills and also ask for advice and information from other employees and the internet for the struggling part. After many nights of additional work, and by using the limited information, I was able to finish the rest of the project with high quality and high standard on time.`

### ??? Question 39: "Tell me about a time when you had to take a calculated risk at work." (Bias for Action)
"In my previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was working on a project to improve the accuracy of a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The existing model was stable but was not performing as well as it could in terms of predicting customer preferences. I identified an opportunity to significantly improve the model by switching to a new algorithm that was more complex and resource-intensive, but it was untested in our specific context."

"My goal was to enhance the recommendation system's accuracy and, ultimately, increase customer satisfaction and sales. The risk involved implementing a new, untested algorithm that required substantial computational resources and could potentially disrupt the current system if it didn’t perform as expected. However, I believed the potential benefits outweighed the risks."

"Before making the switch, I conducted a thorough analysis of the new algorithm’s potential impact, including running simulations and A/B testing on a small subset of data. I also benchmarked the new algorithm against the existing one to compare performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, and resource usage.
To mitigate the risk, I proposed implementing the new algorithm in a phased approach. First, I tested it on a small portion of the live traffic to monitor its real-world performance and ensure it wouldn’t negatively impact the user experience. I set up monitoring tools to track key metrics in real time and created a rollback plan in case the new algorithm underperformed.
I communicated the potential risks and benefits to key stakeholders, ensuring they were aware of the calculated nature of the risk and were on board with the plan."

"The calculated risk paid off. The new algorithm outperformed the existing model by 15% in terms of recommendation accuracy, which led to a noticeable increase in customer engagement and a 10% boost in sales over the following quarter. The phased approach allowed us to safely transition to the new algorithm without any major disruptions.
The success of this initiative demonstrated the value of taking calculated risks and reinforced the importance of innovation in our approach to improving the platform. The project was recognized internally, and the methodology I used for risk assessment and phased implementation became a template for future upgrades."

"This experience taught me the importance of balancing innovation with careful risk management. It reinforced my belief that taking calculated risks, when done with proper analysis and preparation, can lead to significant improvements and competitive advantages. Moving forward, I’ve continued to apply this approach, ensuring that I weigh the potential rewards against the risks and always have a plan in place to mitigate any downsides."

`I was working on a research project and is focused on training deep learning models to recognize user sentiments with limited examples. By chance, I know that some teams in big companies were working on a similar project. I knew that I might be behind them as I do not have enough training resources as big companies, and if they released the work earlier, I would lose many credits and recognitions for my work. So I made a calculated risk, that I decided to mainly focus on the few-shot part, which requires a few examples to train models, and I am also very familiar with this part. Instead, I skip the less familiar zero-shot experimental part where no training examples are available for the models. I quickly trained models and collected the results and analysis into a research paper, and then I released my work. My work turns out to receive lots of attention, and there are several follow-ups and good suggestions. Of course, I received some interest for the zero-shot part results, and I adopted feedbacks and added up the results soon. I think my calculated risk is worth it as my work received lots of attention and many papers follow my work. Besides, the feedbacks make my work better on the following versions.`

### Question 40: "Tell me how you would complete a project or task if you had limited time or resources?" (Frugality)
"In a previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was assigned to develop a prototype for a new recommendation system. The project had a tight deadline due to an upcoming product launch, and I had limited computational resources and a small team to support the task. The challenge was to deliver a functional and accurate prototype within the constraints."

"The goal was to create a working prototype that could demonstrate the potential of the recommendation system to stakeholders and help secure further investment for full development. Despite the limited resources, it was crucial to deliver a high-quality product that would meet the stakeholders’ expectations."

"To manage the constraints, I first prioritized the most critical features of the recommendation system, focusing on delivering the core functionality that would have the most impact. I decided to use a simple yet effective algorithm that could be developed and deployed quickly, rather than a more complex model that would require more time and resources.
To optimize the use of our limited computational resources, I implemented efficient data processing techniques, such as down-sampling the dataset and using approximate algorithms that provided good-enough results with less processing power. I also leveraged open-source tools and pre-built libraries to save time on development.
Given the tight deadline, I adopted an iterative development approach, delivering a basic version of the prototype early on to gather feedback from stakeholders. This allowed me to make adjustments and improvements without spending time on unnecessary features.
I also collaborated closely with my team, delegating tasks based on each member’s strengths and encouraging open communication to quickly address any issues that arose."

"Despite the constraints, I was able to deliver a functional prototype on time that met the key requirements. The prototype successfully demonstrated the potential of the recommendation system, and the stakeholders were impressed with the results, leading to approval for the next phase of development.
The project was completed within the allocated budget, and the efficient use of resources became a model for similar projects within the organization. My ability to prioritize effectively and make the most of limited resources was recognized by my manager, and the project’s success contributed to the company’s strategic goals."

"This experience reinforced the importance of being resourceful and focused when working with limited resources. I learned that by prioritizing the most impactful tasks and finding creative solutions, it’s possible to deliver high-quality results even under constraints. Moving forward, I’ve continued to apply these principles, ensuring that I make the most of what I have while maintaining a high standard of work."

`I was working on a project with limited resources and time, in which the task required to train neural networks to classify movie reviews. However, due to time and budget limit, I could not use several GPUs to train my model because it would cost a lot if I ran multiple experiments, also multiple experiments will take me a lot of time. To complete the project, I made a good plan with priorities. I first carefully survey online related works and blogs, then design better flows of the model architecture. The pipeline requires light models rather than heavy models with lots of parameters. I also adopt several techniques to accelerate my training process. It turns out my model only needs two GPUs to get a good performance, and previously it usually took eight GPUs to finish the whole training process. Besides, It also takes seven hours to finish the entire training process and is much faster than the previous 15 hours. Hence, I could run all my experiments even with limited time, and I could spend extra time to analyze results and write a good document, and the project was finished with high standards and qualities. I learned that we could invent better ways to reduce our resources or save time.`

As we approached the final stages of the project, a conflict arose between the data science team and the software engineering team regarding the implementation of a particular feature. The data scientists believed that the feature was critical for the tool’s accuracy, while the engineers were concerned about the feasibility and potential impact on system performance."

"As a key contributor to both the data science and engineering efforts, I recognized that this conflict needed to be resolved quickly to avoid delays in the project timeline. My task was to facilitate a resolution that would address both teams’ concerns while keeping the project on track."

"I started by organizing a meeting with key members from both teams to discuss the issue in a collaborative environment. I encouraged each side to openly express their concerns and explain their reasoning behind their positions. This helped to ensure that everyone’s perspective was heard and understood.
After understanding both sides, I proposed a compromise that involved implementing a simplified version of the feature that addressed the data science team’s accuracy concerns without overburdening the system. I also suggested an incremental rollout of the feature, where we could monitor its impact on performance and make adjustments as needed.
To ensure transparency and build trust, I documented the decisions made during the meeting and the rationale behind them, and I shared this with the entire team. I also made it a point to check in regularly with both teams to ensure that the solution was working as intended and to address any further concerns."

"The proposed solution was accepted by both teams, and we were able to move forward with the project without significant delays. The incremental rollout of the feature allowed us to maintain system performance while still achieving the desired accuracy improvements.
The resolution of this conflict not only kept the project on track but also improved collaboration between the data science and engineering teams. Both sides appreciated the balanced approach, and it led to stronger teamwork and communication in subsequent projects. The project was ultimately delivered successfully, and the predictive analytics tool received positive feedback from users."

"This experience taught me the importance of open communication and empathy in resolving conflicts. I learned that taking the time to understand different perspectives and facilitating constructive dialogue can lead to solutions that benefit everyone involved. Moving forward, I’ve continued to apply these principles, ensuring that I address conflicts early and collaboratively to maintain a positive and productive team environment."

`I was part of a project team that included five team members. We aimed to participate into a competition, which is important and time-sensitive. During the initial meetings, we got together to discuss and agree upon the pipelines and strategies of the project, and they would also be our action plan. However, two members disagree on their roles and pipeline choices, which causes conflict within the team. I took control of the situation and expressed my concerns that If we cannot all agree to our roles and work closely with each other, we would waste time and all be responsible for the potential failure. After that, the two members knew that they had to sit down and discuss together to put the differences aside. Based on their strengths, I provide suggestions and discussions regarding their roles and concerns. Finally, everyone agrees with the plan and their roles. The project went smoothly according to the plan. We get a good ranking in the competition.`

### Question 42: "Give me two examples of when you have gone above and beyond what was expected?" (Think Big,  Dive Deep)
Example 1: Enhancing a Predictive Model Beyond the Initial Scope

"In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with developing a predictive model to forecast customer churn for a subscription-based service. The initial scope of the project was to build a basic model using existing customer data, with the goal of identifying at-risk customers so the marketing team could intervene."

"My responsibility was to deliver a model that met the basic requirements of predicting churn with reasonable accuracy. However, I saw an opportunity to significantly enhance the value of the project by diving deeper into the data and expanding the model's capabilities."

"Instead of just focusing on the immediate task, I took the initiative to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the customer data. I identified additional factors that could influence churn, such as customer engagement metrics and product usage patterns, which were not initially considered.
I also went beyond the standard modeling approach by incorporating advanced techniques like survival analysis and using external data sources to enrich our customer profiles. I worked closely with the data engineering team to integrate these new data streams into our pipeline.
Recognizing the potential impact of these insights, I proactively developed a set of actionable recommendations for the marketing team, including personalized retention strategies based on the model's predictions."

"The enhanced model significantly outperformed the initial version, improving the prediction accuracy by 20%. The marketing team was able to implement targeted interventions that reduced churn by 15% in the first quarter. My proactive approach not only exceeded the project's expectations but also established a new standard for data-driven decision-making in the company. The project received high praise from senior leadership, and the approach I developed was later adopted across other departments."

"This experience reinforced the value of thinking big and diving deep into projects to uncover additional opportunities for impact. It taught me that by going beyond the initial scope, I can deliver outcomes that not only meet but exceed expectations, driving greater value for the organization."

Example 2: Automating a Manual Process to Save Time and Resources

"During a major product launch, I was responsible for generating weekly performance reports that tracked key metrics like sales, customer engagement, and technical issues. The process was highly manual, requiring hours of data extraction, cleaning, and analysis each week. This was especially challenging given the tight timelines and the need for accuracy."

"My primary responsibility was to ensure that the reports were delivered on time and were accurate. However, I realized that the manual process was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, and it was taking valuable time away from more strategic tasks."

"Recognizing the inefficiency, I took the initiative to automate the entire reporting process. I developed a set of scripts to automatically extract, clean, and analyze the data from various sources. I also created a dashboard that provided real-time insights, allowing stakeholders to access the information they needed without waiting for the weekly reports.
To ensure the new system was robust, I conducted extensive testing and validation. I also trained the team on how to use the dashboard and provided documentation to support its ongoing use."

"The automation reduced the time spent on reporting by 80%, freeing up significant resources for the team to focus on more strategic activities. The real-time dashboard provided stakeholders with instant access to key metrics, improving decision-making speed during the product launch. The project was recognized as a major efficiency improvement, and the automation scripts were later adapted for use in other areas of the company."

"This experience highlighted the importance of always looking for ways to improve processes and deliver greater value, even when it's not explicitly required. By thinking big and diving deep into the problem, I was able to create a solution that not only met the immediate needs but also provided long-term benefits to the organization."

`In one of my previous internships, I was in charge of a project which aimed to design models to classify sentiments of user queries. To do this, I developed a pipeline to collect and analyze data and trained deep learning models to achieve good performance to detect user queries. After finishing the first version, I received positive feedback from others. However, I continue to think about how to improve the projects. I started redesigning the model architectures to accelerate training and inference time. I also unified the design flow cause it would be helpful to large-scale real user scenarios. Besides, I integrate my model output as an API. Although my initial expectation is to design models to achieve good performance on user data, my further improvements make my projects more attractive and powerful. Several other teams could directly integrate my API into their products without redesigning code to adapt my models, and I received several thanks from them.`

### Question 43: "When have you had a disagreement at work, either with a work colleague or a manager?" (Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit)
"In a previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was working on a project to develop a new recommendation engine for our platform. I was collaborating closely with a product manager who wanted to prioritize a quick deployment of a basic version of the engine to meet a tight deadline. However, I believed that taking a little extra time to implement a more advanced model would yield significantly better results for the end users and drive higher engagement."

"My responsibility was to develop the recommendation engine, and I felt strongly that delivering a high-quality product, even if it required a bit more time, was crucial for the long-term success of the platform. The product manager, however, was focused on meeting the immediate deadline and was concerned about the risks of delaying the launch."

"I requested a meeting with the product manager to discuss my concerns. During the meeting, I presented data and projections that showed the potential long-term benefits of implementing the more advanced model. I explained that while the initial deployment might be delayed by a couple of weeks, the improved accuracy of the recommendations could lead to a substantial increase in user satisfaction and retention, which would ultimately justify the delay.
The product manager appreciated the data-driven approach but remained concerned about the launch deadline. We had a candid discussion, and although I strongly believed in my position, I understood the business pressures they were facing. After thoroughly discussing the pros and cons, the decision was made to proceed with the simpler model to meet the deadline.
Despite my initial disagreement, I fully committed to the decision. I worked diligently to ensure the basic model was as effective as possible within the time constraints, and I collaborated with the team to ensure a smooth deployment."

"The basic version of the recommendation engine was successfully deployed on time, and while it was not as sophisticated as I had initially hoped, it performed adequately and met the immediate business needs. Importantly, the project’s success built trust between myself and the product manager, and they later supported the development of the more advanced model, which was rolled out in a subsequent update. This experience strengthened our working relationship and demonstrated my commitment to the team’s goals, even when the decision didn’t align with my initial preference."

"This experience taught me the importance of balancing technical excellence with business needs and the value of clear, respectful communication when disagreements arise. I learned that while it’s essential to advocate for what you believe is right, it’s equally important to support the team once a decision is made. This approach has helped me maintain strong, collaborative relationships with colleagues and managers, even in challenging situations."

`I was working on a project during my internship, and the project aimed to detect user domains with good performance during a interaction with customers. After deploying the project, some users commented that the inference time is slow if there is large-scale test data. I feel it is my responsibility to achieve good performance on user data and think about how to accelerate the inference time. As fast inference time could make models more scalable, it could also save user time and money. I spoke with my manager and suggested optimizing architectures to accelerate the model inference. At first, the manager disagreed because he thought one could use more GPU resources or light and smaller version of the model to make the inference faster than optimizing the model architecture. To convince him, I did experiments to analyze how much money and time we will save, and the performances gap between the light version and the normal version of the model. I also provide simple ways to optimize the model inference structure. After later meetings with figures and numbers, the manager was convinced and agreed to my proposal. As a result, the users are satisfied with the application on large-scale data. My proposed techniques were further used on similar projects.`

### Question 44: "Tell me about a time when you received criticism from a manager or a work colleague? How did you react to the negative feedback?"
`Build over complicate model which need more resource and engineering work, tight deadline. Do a lot of things myself as a hero`
"In a previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was working on a project to develop a predictive model for customer segmentation. I was responsible for selecting and implementing the model, and I chose a complex approach that I believed would provide the most accurate results. `After presenting my initial findings to the team, my manager gave me feedback that the approach I had chosen was overly complex and difficult for the rest of the team to understand and implement.` The manager suggested that I simplify the model to make it more accessible and easier to deploy."

"My task was to develop an effective and efficient model that the entire team could work with. The feedback was significant because it highlighted a gap between my technical focus and the practical needs of the team. I realized that while I was prioritizing accuracy, I had overlooked the importance of simplicity and usability, which are critical for collaboration and deployment."

"Initially, I felt disappointed because I had invested a lot of time and effort into developing the model. However, I quickly recognized the validity of my manager’s feedback. `I understood that for the project to be successful, it needed to be something that everyone on the team could understand and contribute to.`
`I took the feedback as an opportunity to improve. I scheduled a follow-up meeting with my manager to gain more clarity on their concerns and to discuss how I could simplify the model without sacrificing too much accuracy.` I also sought input from my colleagues to understand their perspectives and challenges with the current approach.
Based on the feedback, I revised the model, opting for a simpler algorithm that still met the project’s requirements but was much easier to understand and implement. `I also documented the process and created a user-friendly guide to ensure that the entire team could easily work with the new model.`"

"The simplified model was well-received by the team, and it was successfully implemented and deployed without further issues. The project proceeded smoothly, and the model’s performance met our key objectives. My manager appreciated my willingness to adapt based on feedback, and it strengthened our working relationship.
Additionally, the experience helped me develop a more balanced approach to problem-solving, where I now prioritize not only technical accuracy but also practicality and `ease of use`. `This change in perspective has allowed me to contribute more effectively to collaborative projects and improved my ability to work cross-functionally.`"

"This experience taught me the importance of being open to feedback and the value of simplicity in technical work, especially in collaborative environments. I’ve learned that constructive criticism is an opportunity for growth, and I now actively seek out feedback to continually improve my work. This mindset has made me a more effective team member and has enhanced my ability to deliver solutions that are both technically sound and widely accessible."

`I don’t receive criticism often, but when I receive it, I always take it positively and think about how to improve my performance at work. One situation is that in one of my internships, I was working on releasing my project code to other teams. I have provided good results of my model and show some commands to run the code. However, my manager told me that he is not satisfied with the reading documents. Although they are suitable for teams familiar with our model, they are not friendly and straightforward to new beginners. After careful reflection of what he said, the suggestions, and my current documents. I agreed that I should not just improve the quality of code; I should also improve the quality of reading documents. I then go through several online open-source projects to learn how others design and write the document. I adopt some excellent tricks from them. I also optimize my code structure to make it easier to access for beginners. Finally, I released the project, and it received positive feedback from both my manager and the users in other teams. After that, I learned to keep a high standard and think about details and potential needs from the view of users. My following projects have become much better then.`

### Question 45: "Tell me about your most challenging project or a time you solved a complex problem. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?" (highest standards etc.)
"In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with developing a real-time fraud detection system for a financial services company. The project was highly complex due to the need for accurate and timely detection of fraudulent transactions amidst vast amounts of data, with very high stakes for both the company and its customers."

"My responsibility was to design and implement a machine learning model that could identify fraudulent activities in real-time. The challenge was compounded by the need to process and analyze large volumes of transaction data quickly and accurately, while minimizing false positives and negatives. Additionally, the system needed to integrate seamlessly with the existing infrastructure and comply with stringent regulatory requirements."

"To tackle the complexity, I started by conducting a thorough analysis of historical transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies associated with fraud. I used this analysis to develop a set of features that could effectively capture fraudulent behavior.
I implemented an ensemble approach combining multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks. This allowed the system to leverage the strengths of different models and improve overall accuracy.
To ensure real-time processing, I designed a scalable data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, which allowed us to process and analyze transactions as they occurred. I also implemented a feedback loop where the model continuously learned from new data, improving its performance over time.
Throughout the project, I maintained high standards by conducting rigorous testing and validation to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability. I worked closely with the development team to integrate the system into the existing infrastructure and collaborated with compliance experts to meet regulatory requirements."

"The fraud detection system was successfully deployed and was able to accurately identify and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system reduced false positives by 30% and increased detection rates by 25%, significantly improving the company’s ability to prevent fraud and protect its customers.
The project was recognized as a major success by senior leadership, and the system became a critical component of the company’s fraud prevention strategy. My approach and methodologies were later adopted in other areas of the business, and I received commendations for maintaining high standards and delivering exceptional results."

"This experience taught me the importance of a rigorous, data-driven approach to solving complex problems and maintaining high standards throughout the project lifecycle. I learned that combining innovative techniques with a focus on practical implementation can lead to impactful solutions. Moving forward, I’ve continued to apply these principles to other challenging projects, always striving for excellence and ensuring that my solutions are both effective and reliable."

`The most challenging project is my work on unifying different code models. I was working to build a unified framework to merge various sub-projects together, such that different models could share the same code, and it is thus better to control them. It is pretty challenging that I haven’t done anything related to building underlying frameworks. It also requires me to build the corresponding APIs for the source code and design some visualization tools to interpret model results, and I neither had experiences before. So I started to devote more time to the project and even work in my private time. I made a plan with priorities. First, I googled a lot of papers and checked large open-source projects to learn how others build underlying frameworks. I then learn an online course as quickly as possible for building APIs and python visualization tools. When I come up with my ideas to create them, I will discuss them with my manager and others to make sure my plan is feasible. I implement my ideas and debug the code quickly while maintaining high quality. Finally, I finished the project on time with all the features, and I received positive feedback from the users. I also keep optimizing my code with higher and higher quality to save more user time. Through this process, I learn that it is essential to keep learning new knowledge and optimizing the project with better qualities. Besides, I found that a good schedule with priorities is also important.`

### Question 46: "Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline. How did you handle the situation, and what did you learn from it?" (customer obsession, Deliver Results)
"In a previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was leading the development of a new recommendation engine for a key client. The project had a tight deadline because it was critical for an upcoming marketing campaign. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen technical challenges with integrating the engine into the client's existing system, we missed the original deadline."

"My task was to ensure the recommendation engine was delivered on time and met the client’s requirements. The deadline was crucial because the engine was intended to enhance the client’s marketing efforts, and any delay would impact their campaign effectiveness and potentially affect their business outcomes."

"As soon as it became clear that we were not going to meet the deadline, I promptly informed the client about the delay. I provided a transparent explanation of the issues we were facing and the revised timeline for delivery. I also outlined the steps we were taking to resolve the issues and ensure the quality of the final product.
Internally, I reorganized the team’s priorities and resources to focus on resolving the technical challenges as quickly as possible. I set up daily check-ins to monitor progress and address any new issues promptly. I also worked closely with the client to keep them updated and involved in the process, providing them with interim solutions where possible to mitigate the impact of the delay."

"Despite the initial delay, we were able to deliver the recommendation engine within the revised timeline. The client was appreciative of our transparent communication and the steps we took to address their needs. The engine was successfully integrated into their system and performed as expected, contributing to the success of their marketing campaign.
The experience led to improved processes within our team for managing deadlines and handling unexpected challenges. We implemented more robust risk management practices and contingency planning to prevent similar issues in the future."

"This experience taught me the importance of proactive communication and managing client expectations, especially when facing delays. I learned that while missing a deadline is challenging, maintaining transparency and focusing on delivering high-quality results can help preserve client trust and satisfaction. Moving forward, I’ve applied these lessons by enhancing our project planning and risk management strategies, ensuring we are better prepared to meet deadlines and deliver on our commitments."

`I was working on an intern project with a strict deadline. The manager required me to collect new user queries, train models on them, and present a thorough performance analysis in the next meeting which is four days later. The task was very new to my team, and I realized the big magnitude based on the initial information. I put the task as my top-1 priority and started to gather the user queries. But as I was going through it, I realized that the data was much bigger than my expectation, and it was very noisy and complex. I carefully clean the data and analyze the distributions and attributes of the data. I deploy some models on a small scale of data to find the best ones. Due to limited training resources in my department, I also quickly read related papers and learned new skills to optimize my model architectures and save the training time. I put all my extra time on the nights and my whole weekend. However, I still failed to complete all the performance analyses by the meeting, and I presented partial results. My manager was not happy initially, but he is willing to give me more time based on the high-quality summary of my partial results. I then showed my following detailed plans to him, and continue work hard to finish the rest part.  Finally I finished all the parts with high standards.`

### Question 47: "Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?" (Ownership)
"In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was primarily focused on developing predictive models and improving our data analytics capabilities. However, during a critical product launch, our team faced a significant issue with the deployment pipeline. The issue was impacting our ability to release new features on schedule. Although I had no direct responsibility for the deployment process, it was clear that the problem was affecting our project’s timeline and overall success."

"Recognizing the urgency of the situation, I decided to take ownership of the problem. My task was to troubleshoot the deployment pipeline, even though it was outside my area of expertise. I needed to understand the deployment process, identify the bottlenecks, and work with the DevOps team to resolve the issues."

"I started by quickly familiarizing myself with the deployment pipeline and its components. I reviewed the documentation and spoke with the DevOps team to understand the root causes of the issue. I then took a hands-on approach, working closely with the DevOps team to diagnose and resolve the bottlenecks. I also identified areas where improvements could be made to prevent similar issues in the future.
To ensure that the deployment issue was resolved efficiently, I organized daily stand-up meetings with the team to track progress and address any emerging problems. I also provided updates to the project stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress."

"By taking ownership of the deployment issue, we were able to resolve the bottlenecks and get the pipeline back on track. This allowed us to meet our product launch deadline and ensure that new features were released as planned. The successful resolution of the issue was recognized by the senior management team, and my initiative was commended for its impact on the project’s success.
Additionally, the improvements we implemented to the deployment process helped streamline future releases, leading to increased efficiency and fewer deployment-related issues."

"This experience reinforced the importance of taking ownership and being proactive, even when tasks fall outside of my usual responsibilities. I learned that stepping up to address critical issues, regardless of my primary role, can have a significant positive impact on the team and the project. This approach has made me more versatile and collaborative, and I continue to apply these lessons by looking for opportunities to contribute beyond my immediate scope and support the team’s overall goals."

`During my internship, I was working on a project that focused on training models with limited user data. Some internal data augmentation tools from our company could augment and generate more data examples. I then use their tools to generate examples for my case. However, by chance, I found that their source code has a significant flaw that the two techniques used in wrong ways during implementation. I think it is very important to raise the issue as many users may also use these tools, and bad results could negatively impact our company. I then raised the issue to the corresponding team, but they told me that the person in charge had left; thus, it would take them a long time to fix it. I then spent extra time on nights and weekends to analyze their code and fix the problem. I also wrote a document with a better guideline to use the tools. Finally, there are no more issues with their data augmentation tools. I received official thanks from that team, and my manager also praised me.`

### Question 48: "What is the biggest mistake you made, and what did you learn from it?" (earn trust, customer obsession)
"In my role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with developing a predictive model for a major client’s marketing campaign. I made the mistake of underestimating the importance of thorough data preprocessing. I rushed through the preprocessing phase to meet a tight deadline, resulting in a model that was trained on incomplete and poorly cleaned data."

"My responsibility was to ensure the model provided accurate predictions based on the client’s data. The mistake was significant because it led to inaccurate predictions, which affected the client’s campaign performance and led to a loss of trust in our team’s capabilities."

"Once I realized the mistake, I immediately informed the client and my team about the issue. I took full responsibility and apologized for the oversight. I then prioritized correcting the problem by conducting a thorough data cleaning and preprocessing process. I re-trained the model with the corrected data and conducted extensive validation to ensure its accuracy.
To mitigate the impact, I worked closely with the client to provide interim solutions and offered additional support to address any issues caused by the initial errors. I also implemented a more rigorous data preprocessing checklist and review process to prevent similar mistakes in the future."

"After correcting the model, the client was satisfied with the improved results, and the accuracy of the predictions significantly enhanced their campaign performance. Although the initial mistake caused some disruption, the transparent communication and prompt resolution helped rebuild the client’s trust in our team.
Additionally, the new data preprocessing procedures and review processes we put in place improved the quality of our work and prevented similar issues in subsequent projects."

"This experience taught me the importance of thoroughness and attention to detail, especially under tight deadlines. I learned that rushing through critical tasks can lead to significant errors and impact customer trust. Moving forward, I’ve made a commitment to maintain high standards in all aspects of my work and to communicate transparently with clients when issues arise. This approach has helped me earn and maintain trust and ensure that I deliver high-quality results consistently."

`The biggest mistake I made is that when I was working on an intern project. I need to create a demo with live interactions with users where my model could correctly detect the sentiments of user queries. The deadline is very tight, and I need to finish it within one week. At that time, I was building a high-performance classification model, which was an essential part of the demo. I paid too much attention to the details because I wanted to make the system ‍‌‌‍‌‍‌‍‍‌perfect to detect user queries. And I did not notice that I didn’t have enough time to finish all the details. The last day before the deadline, my manager pointed this out. I apologized to him, and I started to figure out a way to keep the demo as we wanted but sacrificing the model inference time that the customer won’t notice because this is just a demo. After presenting the demo, I rewrite the model inference code to meet all the requirements. Finally, the demo has a good influence on users. But from this mistake, I learned that although details are definitely important, I also need to pay attention to the whole project schedule. Besides, I also need to keep good communication and updates with my teammates and managers when I have plans.`

### Question 49: "What is your greatest strength?"
"My greatest strength is my problem-solving ability. I thrive in situations where I need to analyze complex problems and come up with innovative solutions."

"In my previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer, I was tasked with optimizing a recommendation algorithm that was underperforming. The challenge was to improve the algorithm’s accuracy while maintaining its efficiency, given the constraints of a large and diverse dataset.
I approached this by breaking down the problem into smaller components and conducting a thorough analysis of each. I implemented several advanced techniques, including feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, and integrated an ensemble approach to combine the strengths of multiple models. This resulted in a significant improvement in the algorithm’s accuracy and performance.
The enhanced recommendation system led to better user engagement and satisfaction, and the project was recognized as a success by senior management."

"My problem-solving skills have consistently enabled me to tackle complex challenges effectively and deliver high-quality results. In this instance, the improved recommendation system contributed to increased user retention and positive feedback from clients. It also demonstrated my ability to deliver impactful solutions, which reinforced my reputation as a reliable and innovative team member."

"I believe this strength is particularly relevant to the AWS Applied Scientist L6 role, where complex problem-solving is essential for developing and optimizing data-driven solutions. My ability to analyze and address intricate challenges will allow me to contribute effectively to your team and drive impactful results for your clients."

"Overall, my problem-solving ability has been a key driver of my success in previous roles, and I am confident it will enable me to excel in this position as well. I look forward to applying this strength to tackle the complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions at AWS."

`I am very good at planning and scheduling, I usually make a good plan for my projects and set up milestones for every week.`

### Question 50: "What is your greatest weakness?"
"One area where I've identified a need for improvement is `my tendency to become deeply involved in technical details, which can sometimes cause me to lose sight of the broader project goals`."

"In a previous project, I was focused on optimizing a machine learning model and spent a significant amount of time refining the algorithm. While this attention to detail led to some performance improvements, it also caused delays in delivering the overall project and affected the timeline for other critical components."

"To address this, I’ve worked on improving my time management and project oversight skills. I started using project management tools to track progress and set more defined milestones for both technical tasks and overall project objectives. I also regularly review project goals with my team to ensure that my focus aligns with the broader objectives and timelines."

"As a result of these changes, I’ve been able to balance technical work with project deadlines more effectively. For instance, in a subsequent project, I successfully managed to complete the technical enhancements while meeting the overall project deadlines, which led to positive feedback from both clients and team members."

"In the AWS Applied Scientist L6 role, the ability to manage complex projects while maintaining a clear focus on strategic goals is crucial. My efforts to improve my project management and oversight skills will help me contribute effectively to your team, ensuring that I deliver high-quality solutions on time while keeping aligned with broader objectives."

"Overall, acknowledging and working on this weakness has made me a more effective and balanced team member. I am committed to ongoing improvement and believe that my enhanced skills in managing both technical details and project objectives will be a valuable asset in this role."

`My weakness is that sometimes I would pay more attention to the details of a project and spend too much time analyzing detailed results or findings. One example is designing a multi-modal fusion model to encode different information, including texts and images. I need to get the initial results on the target dataset. While during the experiments, I spent much time analyzing whether different pre-training computer vision models affect the retrieved quality of images. Actually, we can use any pre-training models to get the feature. It takes me extra hours to finish the project. Later, I try to check myself with regular milestones and refocus on the big picture, like first designing a whole model to handle all of them instead of only focusing on small parts. Finally, I finished my work with high quality and submitted it to a top-tier conference before the deadline.`

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
7. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 不趋附大众,敢于提出自己的意见
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
Use ML based solution to replace current heuristic.

8. Deliver Results 排除万难,最后完成任务, 或者最终失败学到了什么
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
我的项目launch A/B test发现performance不好。然后我dive deep into it，首先check 有没有engineering bugs；然后check 模型performance是不是和offline metrics match；然后check feature distribution有没有shift。然后我发现了问题所在。然后我做了这几个change，然后重新上线了，performance improve x%
显示出一个系统性逻辑性的解决问题方法。而高级的回答显示出了面试者quantitative and critical thinking的mindset

9. Insist on the Highest Standards 不妥协自己的高要求
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
In DS team, insist the code quality and standards even it will take some time to implement and trade-off balance.

10. Learn and Be Curious 学习工作外的事情
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Learn a lot engineering and cloud knowledge to understand the entire ml life cycle and make it easier to collaborate with tech and business teams. Study and get AWS solution architecture and ML certificates.

11. Ownership 不只顾着自己的一亩三分地, 为了长期利益履行工作分外的职责; sacrifice short-term profit for long-term gain
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”
Balance modeling and engineering.

12. Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
13. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.
14. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
15. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
16. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
- The best way to pick it up is via learning by doing
If you’re still keen on becoming more end-to-end, we’ll now discuss how to do so. Before that, without going into specific technology, here are the buckets of skills that end-to-end data scientists commonly use:
Product: Understand customer problems, define and prioritize requirements
Communication: Facilitate across teams, get buy-in, write docs, share results
Data engineering: Move and transform data from point A to B
Data analysis: Understand and visualize data, A/B testing & inference
Machine learning: The usual plus experimentation, implementation, and metrics
Software engineering: Production code practices including unit tests, docs, logging
Dev Ops: Basic containerization and cloud proficiency, build and automation tools
(This list is neither mandatory nor exhaustive. Most projects don’t require all of them.)
Here are four ways you can move closer to being an end-to-end data scientist:
- Study the right books and courses. (Okay, this is not learning by doing but we all need to start somewhere). I would focus on courses that cover tacit knowledge rather than specific tools. While I’ve not come across such materials, I’ve heard good reviews about Full Stack Deep Learning.
- Do your own projects end-to-end to get first-hand experience of the entire process. At the risk of oversimplifying it, here are some steps I would take with their associated skills. I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand. – Confucius
Start with identifying a problem to solve and determining the success metric (product). Then, find some raw data (i.e., not Kaggle competition data); this lets you clean and prepare the data and create features (data engineering). Next, try various ML models, examining learning curves, error distributions, and evaluation metrics (data science).
Assess each model’s performance (e.g., query latency, memory footprint) before picking one and writing a basic inference class around it for production (software engineering). (You might also want to build a simple user interface). Then, containerise and deploy it online for others to use via your preferred cloud provider (dev ops).
Once that’s done, go the extra mile to share about your work. You could write an article for your site or speak about it at a meetup (communication). Show what you found in the data via meaningful visuals and tables (data analysis). Share your work on GitHub. Learning and working in public is a great way to get feedback and find potential collaborators.
- Volunteer through groups like DataKind. DataKind works with social organizations (e.g., NGOs) and data professionals to address humanitarian issues. By collaborating with these NGOs, you get the opportunity to work as part of a team to tackle real problems with real(ly messy) data.
While volunteers may be assigned specific roles (e.g., PM, DS), you’re always welcome to tag along and observe. You’ll see (and learn) how PMs engage with NGOs to frame the problem, define solutions, and organize the team around it. You’ll learn from fellow volunteers how to work with data to develop working solutions.
- Join a startup-like team. Note: A startup-like team is not synonymous with a startup. There are big organizations that run teams in a startup-like manner (e.g., two-pizza teams) and startups made up of specialists. Find a lean team where you’re encouraged, and have the opportunity, to work end-to-end.


6. Please share a time when you had to share or pitch an idea to someone in a more senior position. How did you go about this task, and what was the outcome?
`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
- The goal of data science is not to execute. Rather, the goal is to learn and develop new business capabilities. … There are no blueprints; these are new capabilities with inherent uncertainty. … All the elements you’ll need must be learned through experimentation, trial and error, and iteration. – Eric Colson
He suggests that data science roles should be made more general, with broad responsibilities agnostic to technical function and optimized for learning. Thus, his team hires and grows generalists who can conceptualize, model, implement, and measure. Of course, this is dependent on a solid data platform that abstracts away the complexities of infra setup, distributed processing, monitoring, automated failover, etc.
Having end-to-end data scientists improved Stitch Fix’s learning and innovation capabilities, enabling them to discover and build more business capabilities (relative to a specialist team).
Netflix Edge Engineering initially had specialized roles. However, this created inefficiencies across the product life cycle. Code releases took more time (weeks instead of days), deployment problems took longer to detect and resolve, and production issues required multiple back-and-forth communications.
To address this, they experimented with Full Cycle Developers who were empowered to work across the entire software life cycle. This required a mindset shift—instead of just considering design and development, devs also had to consider deployment and reliability.
To support full cycle devs, centralized teams built tooling to automate and simplify common development process (e.g., build and deploy pipelines, monitoring, managed rollbacks). Such tooling is reusable across multiple teams, acts as a force multiplier, and helped devs be effective across the entire cycle.
With the full cycle developer approach, Edge Engineering was able to iterate quicker (instead of coordinating across teams), with faster and more routine deployments.
Data science is part software engineering, part research and innovation, and fully about using data to create impact and value. Aspects of data science that work well with agile tend to be more of the engineering nature, while those closer related to research tends not to fit as well.
-  my examples
At IBM, I was on a team that created job recommendations for staff. Running the entire pipeline took a very long time. I thought we could halve the time by moving the data prep and feature engineering pipelines into the database. But, the database guy didn’t have time to test this. Being impatient, I ran some benchmarks and reduced overall run time by 90%. This allowed us to experiment 10x faster and save on compute cost in production.
While building Lazada’s ranking system, I found Spark necessary for data pipelines (due to the large data volume). However, our cluster only supported the Scala API which I was unfamiliar with. Not wanting to wait (for data engineering support), I chose the faster—but painful—route of figuring out Scala Spark and writing the pipelines myself. This likely halved dev time and gave me a better understanding of the data to build a better model.
After a successful A/B test, we found that business stakeholders didn’t trust the model. As a result, they were manually picking top products to display, decreasing online metrics (e.g., CTR, conversion). To understand more, I made trips to our marketplaces (e.g., Indonesia, Vietnam). Through mutual education, we were able to address their concerns and reduce the amount of manual overwriting and reap the gains.
In the examples above, going out of the regular DS & ML job scope helped with delivering more value, faster. In the last example, it was necessary to unblock our data science efforts.
You may not be end-to-end now. That’s okay—few people are. Nonetheless, consider its benefits and stretching closer towards it.
Which aspects would disproportionately improve your ability to deliver as a data scientist? Increased engagement with customers and stakeholders to design more holistic, innovative solutions? Building and orchestrating your own data pipelines? Greater awareness of engineering and product constraints for faster integration and deployments?
- A couple months after publishing this, I realize some readers interpret this post from the skills and technical knowledge perspective. They see this post as pushing for data scientists / ML engineers to be full-stack and have in-depth knowledge of how to set up K8s, do PhD-level research, design front-end, etc. That’s not my intention.
Instead, I’m trying to convince that end-to-end visibility, cohesion (i.e., reverse Conway’s Law), and ownership leads to better outcomes. Although visibility should be paired with ability to make an impact, for a start, its sufficient to be able to use the tools without being able to set it up yourself. The effective data scientists I know are power users of their tools even without being able to set it up from scratch (though I’m sure they can pick it up fast).

as MLE to solve DS issues.
Difficult clients are part of any business, particularly fields such as customer service and sales. Clients can place unrealistic demands, refuse to listen and even become rude, but it’s important to remain professional no matter what. Being able to resolve situations with difficult clients is an important skill in itself that indicates professionalism, grace and patience.
For me, the first step in dealing with a difficult client is getting on the same page. When things don’t go a person’s way, they often assume you’re malicious and become defensive. Of course, this isn’t the case, and my first priority is proving this. Once I reassure a difficult client that their success is also in my best interest, it always becomes easier to resolve their problem.
- First and foremost, listen. Do not try to talk over the customer or argue with them. Let the customer have their say, even if you know what they are going to say next, that they don't have all the information or that they are mistaken. As you listen, take the opportunity to build rapport with the customer.
- Build rapport through empathy. Put yourself in the customer's shoes. Echo the source of their frustration and show that you understand their position and situation. If you can empathize with a customer's problem, it will help calm them down.
- Lower your voice. If the customer gets louder, speak slowly, in a low tone. Your calm demeanor can carry over to them and help them to settle down. As you approach the situation with a calm, clear mind, unaffected by the customer's tone or volume, their anger will generally dissipate.
- Respond as if all your customers are watching. Pretend you are not talking only to the customer but to an audience that is watching the interaction. This shift in perspective can provide an emotional buffer if the customer is being verbally abusive and will allow you to think more clearly when responding. Since an unruly customer can be a negative referral, assume they'll repeat the conversation to other potential customers; this mindset can help you do your best to address their concerns in a calming way.
- Stay calm. If the customer is swearing or being verbally abusive, take a deep breath and continue as if you didn't hear them. Responding in kind will not solve anything, and it will usually escalate the situation. Instead, remind the customer that you are there to help them and are their best immediate chance of resolving the situation. This simple statement often helps defuse the situation.
- Remember that you're interacting with a human. Everyone has an occasional bad day. Maybe your rude customer had a fight with their spouse, got a traffic ticket that morning or had a recent run of bad luck. We've all been there, to some degree. Try to empathize and make their day better by being a pleasant, calming voice – it'll make you feel good, too.
- Summarize the next steps. At the end of the call, let the customer know exactly what to expect, and then be sure to follow through on your promises. Document the call to ensure you're well prepared for the next interaction.
- I would always answer this question by talking about being flexible, understanding and patient.
Flexibility - Different users require a different approach, some will need hand holding, others just need the issue resolved. You need to be able to change the way you speak/act for the different people and their different moods.
Understanding/Empathy - Understand not only their technical issue but also their driver, are they being difficult because they are stressed/under pressure to deliver or frustrated because they do not understand the issue? Understanding the root issue of why someone is being difficult is the first step in making them feel like they are getting the assistance and service they require and also it will make you less mad at them for being a pain in the arse!
Patience - An obvious one but this goes along way. So long as you've grasped the fact the customer is angry, acknowledged that and you are speaking to them in a suitable manor for them, you simply need to have patience to 'take their shit' and resolve their issue or come to an agreed course of action. If you ever feel that you are becoming angry, take a step back from the call.
Follow up - If its appropriate, always follow up the issue. This is a two fold thing, firstly it ensures you've resolved the issue and they are happy (from a difficult customer to a happy customer is what you're aiming for) and secondly, it raises you and the department, it proves not only that you are interested in resolving the issue but also you are happy to deal with this customer again in the future and you want to ensure you've done all you can - even if they are still being difficult.

In addition to listing techniques you’d use when dealing with a difficult customer, support your claims with an anecdote. Sharing a detailed example of how you’ve employed the above strategies when handling real life customer conflict is an effective way to reinforce how you’d handle hypothetical situations in the future.  Follow the STAR method to successfully tell a conflict resolution success story.
Situation. Keep your explanation simple, but tell your story using enough context for the employer to get a clear picture.
Task. It’s important to describe your role / responsibility both on the job and in the situation.
Action. Describe how you implemented the strategies listed above, and any additional techniques of your own, to find a resolution.
Result. Make sure to mention the specific positive conclusion that was reached, and anything further that may have resulted such as a positive review, or referral, etc.

Listen carefully to the customer.  When a customer is upset, the first thing they want is an opportunity to air their grievances. An employer is looking to hear that you’ll take some time to hear them out, which involves listening patiently, and asking follow-up questions. Be sure to highlight the importance of body language, posture, and eye contact – for example, standing or sitting up straight with uncrossed arms will come across to a customer as welcoming and attentive.

Repeat what you’ve just heard. Summarizing and reiterating the customer’s main concerns will ensure they feel understood, maximize your understanding of their complaint, and provide them with some time to (hopefully) calm down a bit.

Remain calm and compassionate. One of the most important qualities an interviewer is looking for with regard to a difficult customer is a candidate’s ability to remain calm during tense interactions. Speaking in an even tone is an important strategy to mention, as it typically prevents a situation from escalating too far. Reminding yourself that the customer isn’t angry with you, but dissatisfied with product performance or a provided service, will help you avoid taking anything personally.

9. Tell me about a time when you experienced conflict at work. How did you overcome it?
`failure`, `conflict`

10. What’s one thing you’ve done in your professional history that you wish you would have handled differently?

11. As a leader, how do you motivate those who follow you?
https://www.universalcreativesolutions.com/insights/11-effective-leadership-strategies-to-motivate-your-team
`Learn end-to-end pipeline/take multiple roles`
allocate tasks to proper individuals
Those in leadership positions need to be able to motivate their subordinates. Good morale is one of the keys to maximizing the quality of work, as well as quantity. By learning how a person motivates their team members, you’ll gain a look into their interpersonal skills, maturity and knack for management.
I believe that when you set people up to succeed while doing work they’re good at, they motivate themselves. I get to know my team members as individuals, make use of their unique skills and show my appreciation and awareness for the contributions they make.

- Ask them Communicate
Communicate (in a way that not only informs, but inspires).
Explain exactly what you need, by when, and why. Explaining the bigger picture lets others see how their contributions will matter and provides the context needed to make better decisions about how to accomplish tasks.
Start with scheduling more one on one time. Get off on the right track by making consistent clear goals and expectations an operational reality. You do that through the lost art of one-on-one conversations -- a great motivational tool. Leaders thrive when they strengthen relationships with their people by spending more one-on-one time with them to hear their suggestions, ideas, problems and issues as well as talking about performance issues and their work.
Find out what motivates them. Do you know what gets your team members out of bed in the morning? What they're passionate about -- their goals, aspirations, and interests? In other words, do you really know your team members? Great leaders show an interest in their people's jobs and career aspirations in order to motivate them the right way. Once that's been established, they look into the future to create learning and development opportunities for their people. They find out what motivates their best people by getting to know what desires will drive each team member. This is about emotional engagement.
Provide the resources they need to do their work exceptionally well. It's a simple question, but you'd be surprised how often it is not asked: What do you need right now to do your job better? You may be surprised, or even shocked at the answer; it could be that they need access to more information to make the right decisions, bettter equipment or even another work space. Acting on what you find out will be a huge motivational booster.
No one comes to work with the intent to do nothing and fail. It is that over time people get frustrated by their leadership, the lack of understanding and support.
Hence, leaders need to invite people to discussion, listen and understand what motivates each individual team member. You will find similarities and differences. Ask about there happy moments, their frustrations; their dislikes and likes. Ask them why they are around. Get their vision and mission. What they need to succeed.
The answers will provide input to your vision and implementation plan, to your inspiring narrative which makes the team move - the original meaning of the word motivating. Not through external energy and push but through the appeal of the joint undertaking and the removal of the barriers that often stop people to advance.
The best way to motivate your followers is to understand what motivates them. Take some time talking to them, understanding their values and goals. Then look to create an environment which caters to that.
As leaders our job is to motivate and lead people to achieve team goals.  In our experience, setting our teams up for success starts with understanding and communicating:  What’s In It For WE (WIIFW?)
When we motivate individuals, we engage the collective group to collaborate to work together towards common goals.
Establish Good Communication - Part of setting a clear goal is effective communication within your organization, but communication isn’t a one-way street. You should ensure that employees are in constant communication with each other, and this should be one of the most important elements of your communication and leadership strategy. This way, you can hear ideas, opinions, and feedback while keeping them informed about the tasks at hand. This can have a positive effect on your business, as it can resolve dilemmas in different ways. Make sure you are open and approachable in your attitude and communication and are available for them to get projects moving.
- Involve them/Align Teams
Ask them what it will take for them to get involved. Everyone is different, and what may be highly motivating for one person could be agony for someone else. Find out what motivates them and tailor your expectations accordingly.
Tell a story. Stories don’t tell people what to do. They engage people’s imaginations and emotions. They show people what they’re capable of becoming or of doing. Align on your purpose and values. This is the most important thing you can do in your business and the best way to motivate your employees. Know your purpose. Know your “why.” Why does your company exist? Then set defined values for your organization and ensure employees are not only aware of them, but live them out every single day. Values are a great way to keep everyone on the same page with expectations.
When there’s an immediate, short-term and specific goal that you want your people to achieve, you need to motivate them. When you want to shape people’s identity and their long-term aspirations and commitments, you need to inspire them.
There are 2 things that immediately come to mind: 1) Significant meaning and 2) Purposeful contribution. When people feel there is a definable meaning for what they are doing, and they embrace that meaning, they will work very hard. Add to this, they believe their contribution to the project is important and they will press thru to complete the project. Conversely, if its ‘just a job’ and they don’t think they are making a difference, you will have unmotivated people.
People are also motivated when they know the leader cares for them. If they feel like a tool the leaders uses to accomplish his/her goals, they will not work hard. However, if they feel the leader is genuinely concerned for their wellbeing, they will go into battle for the leader.
For teams to achieve collective objectives, people need to understand not just what to do but also, why and how it relates to their individual goals.  As leaders, when we think in terms of WE, we are able to motivate people in ways that are meaningful to them as individuals, because we are not only focused on the big picture goal but also the individual efforts we need to achieve that goal.
During challenging and uncertain times, motivating our teams is even more important.  But even as we are encountering challenges and uncertainty, there are key things that remain as motivating factors for people in the workplace.  At work, motivation is about understanding why people choose to work with us – we all have many career choices.  So why do people choose to work with some teams over others – As a leader, what do you offer that inspires people to choose to work with you rather than someone else? Individuals are motivated by different things – money, status, rewards, recognition – but what really motivates people is the opportunity to make important contributions. When working on a team, we are sharing our value to contribute to a goal.  Good leaders find ways to provide individuals the opportunity to speak up and share.  We can motivate people by making them feel encouraged to share their unique value to contribute to the collective goals.
Leading is achieving more together than we can alone.  Which is why motivation is so important.  Good leaders acknowledge individual and collective contributions as goals are met.  When leaders recognize the contributions of a team, it not only helps build motivation and momentum, but also builds connections between the efforts of the team and the goals of the organization (WIIFW – What’s In It For We?).  When individuals understand how their contributions have contributed to success, they build confidence in their abilities.  Sharing success is not only about recognizing achievements, but also about sharing that those achievements are accomplished through group efforts. Empowering your team to come to the table with new ideas, alternate approaches and unique suggestions will increase motivation and foster a more positive team culture.
The best kind of company is one where everyone works together, and employees feel integrated into the company and its processes in a certain way. This motivates them to achieve better results and makes them feel “integrated” into the companies and their processes. Supporting the alignment within your team promotes productivity, which can result in employees feeling valued, which further results in motivation. Encourage everyone to work together to achieve better results: encourage your team members, your employees, as well as your customers.
- Set clear goals/Share Your Goals
that are a little bit of a “stretch,” but are attainable based on the person’s skill set and experience. Goals that are too easy won’t push them to improve, but goals that are too hard may frustrate them and actually cause them to lose motivation. The right goals provide just the push they need to be their best selves.
Instead of setting large long-term goals for your team, set small, attainable, short-term goals for each individual employee that align to a larger mission objective. Going back to the importance of communication, make sure you’re communicating regularly with them to keep them on track. When they achieve their short-term goal, celebrate them in order to encourage this behavior in the future.
Set clear, measurable goals to articulate your vision so that your teams can track progress and see their success in a tangible way. To achieve this, you need to make sure that your employees are fully aware of the goals you ultimately pursue for your company. Employees usually get a deeper understanding of the task at hand if the management has a clear idea of why certain tasks need to be done to achieve the end goal.
You can only inspire and motivate a team if your team has an idea of the task they’re working on, but the question is, how does a leader inspire their team? Follow your SMART goals in terms of team motivation and strive to get the best out of each team member by being direct, specific, and clear. Establish good leadership by communicating with everyone in the team, setting up routine meetings with your teams, and being clear about your goals, and goals of the organization. Showing your team that you care about their goals is an effective way to build relationships and increase team motivation. As a leader, you should encourage your teams to combine their professional and personal goals with the goals of the organization.
Give Feedback - You can also motivate your team members to work hard and get the best out of them by giving constructive feedback. Motivate and encourage them to exceed your expectations. It’s great to find thoughtful ways to motivate a team, and it’s directly related to your company’s success. Effective employee check - we know exactly what team members do to achieve the overall goals, mission, and vision of the company with positive feedback. In theory, these reviews allow management to indicate how well employees are meeting expectations, achieving their goals, and contributing to the company’s success, in order to improve engagement and motivate employees to perform better. To promote the goal and achievement of the goals by team members, recurring employee checks - in, weekly or monthly - can be an effective motivator.
- Trust/Support them
Give them the autonomy to decide how the work will be done, within certain parameters. Give them ownership, but make sure they know you are available for questions.
The best managers delegate often and give their employees responsibility for delivering challenging work.
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the French aviator and author of “The Little Prince”, wrote, “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” Sometimes you need to do both. You need to enlist and organize people to do a specific task-to build a ship according to specs, on time and on budget-and sometimes you need to activate people’s desires and stand aside. Who knows, you may be surprised by what they do.
- Appreciate/Reward them
Thank them sincerely. Praise publicly and share positive feedback with their supervisors, as well as with other teammates.
Provide tangible evidence of your gratitude. Send a handwritten note thanking them for the extra effort on a large project. Certificates, gift cards, plaques, public recognition, another interesting project, and more responsibility are all ways to reward people. Even if you have only a tiny budget, you can do something to show your gratitude.
Managers have to get into the habit of praising and complimenting their people for their good qualities and work. The companies in Gallup's study with the highest engagement levels use recognition and praise as a powerful motivator to get their commitment. They found that employees who receive it on a regular basis increase their individual productivity, receive higher loyalty and satisfaction scores from customers, and are more likely to stay with their organization.
Motivating others isn’t just about giving inspiring speeches or writing an amazing company vision statement. It’s about following up and providing the support people need to achieve their goals. It means providing the physical tools and programs they need to succeed, but also providing emotional support. Ask them how you can help. Let them know you’re there for them. And always follow up and keep them on track for success.
Give Recognition - Praising team members for their good work can have a huge impact on employee morale. Sometimes the power of positive praise is overlooked, but when employees achieve results, make extra effort or do an excellent job, praise them and tell them what you are grateful for. Don’t just say “good job” - don’t explain why it’s a good job or how it helps the company. Your team members see how they approach your company’s goals, not just the results of their work. Expressing gratitude is easy to implement almost immediately. What’s more is that they become an integral part of the company culture. However, other approaches might take time to properly implement and can result in some problems within the team if they feel overworked and demotivated as a result. You can make employees feel more responsible by continuing to grow their skills.  People want to know that their efforts are being appreciated, and sincere praise is a great success, especially when leaders publicly or privately acknowledge their achievements. You can see it in other positive moments, but wait until you have finished the project to show gratitude and pay tribute. It not only motivates your employees but also helps them to succeed in their future work. Reward your team for their hard work and commitment to your company’s goals, not just your own.
- Challenge them/Provide Opportunities for Growth
Start a friendly competition among teams or departments, ideally one in which everyone can win or learn something.
Help them develop new skills. actually giving them meaningful new skills or knowledge in other areas that they can use to leverage their natural strengths for future roles, whether with their current company or another company. The point is to serve and value them so exceptionally well as people and workers that they have no reason to leave but use their newfound skills for new projects.
Another thing you can do is to give them opportunities to learn and develop. Everyone wants to succeed and be good at something. If you understand which direction your followers want to grow in and give them those opportunities they will definitely feel motivated.
To motivate and inspire the team to achieve good results, employees should be equipped with growth and development opportunities. Empower your team to develop itself through on-site training and education. Provide your team and individuals with training and development opportunities that enable people to continuously improve and improve their skills. When individuals bring new skills to the team environment, it can lift everyone up and make a positive change in their work environment.
It can be difficult to get people excited about the journey to work, especially when the daily working environment is unpleasant. However, when teams learn something new together, it can help them connect and build new connections. These opportunities should be tailored to each individual employee and can be seen as challenging goals, such as inviting employees to shadow you or serve as a teacher or mentor in your own time. Encourage your team to set learning goals and focus on teaching them transferable skills that they could use for different positions.
Employees can come up with new ways to work together on problems, build stronger bonds that serve to improve the overall morale of the team, and of course, develop new skills that can be used to improve their performance on future projects. Challenges help your team grow as individuals and as a team, so give people the chance to do something different from going to work as always. A challenge, such as meeting a deadline, can help recharge teams that feel bogged down in playing day-to-day.
People are always excited to learn new things and develop new skills. This is especially true when said skills help them perform better at their jobs. Make sure your goals are both achievable and realistic. This ensures that their experience of working in the team is motivating – not discouraging.
Showing your team how a particular set of skills leads to business results is an excellent way to encourage the development of new skills such as teamwork and communication skills.  
You can also help motivate your team by responding positively to the skills and abilities that members bring to a team. Motivational leaders, for example, help build trust and can encourage team members to move toward goals and achieve common goals. It can be a great way to inspire and motivate people without using emotional tactics, as people respond to intrinsic and extrinsic rewards.

- being end-to-end
I found this worrying. It’s difficult to be effective when the data science process (problem framing, data engineering, ML, deployment/maintenance) is split across different people. It leads to coordination overhead, diffusion of responsibility, and lack of a big picture view.
IMHO, I believe data scientists can be more effective by being end-to-end. Here, I’ll discuss the benefits and counter-arguments, how to become end-to-end, and the experiences of Stitch Fix amakend Netflix. An end-to-end data scientist can identify and solve problems with data, to deliver value. To achieve the goal, they’ll wear as many (or as little) hats as required. They’ll also learn and apply whatever tech, methodology, and process that works. Throughout the process, they ask questions such as:
What is the problem? Why is it important?
Can we solve it? How should we solve it?
What is the estimated value? What was the actual value?
For most data science roles, being more end-to-end improves your ability to make meaningful impact.
Working end-to-end provides increased context. While specialized roles can increase efficiency, it reduces context (for the data scientist) and leads to suboptimal solutions. The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up. – Chuck Palahniuk
It’s hard to design a holistic solution without full context of the upstream problem.
Similarly, it’s risky to develop a solution without awareness of downstream engineering and product constraints. There’s no point:
Building a near-real time recommender if infra and engineer cannot support it
Building an infinite scroll recommender if it doesn’t fit in our product and app
By working end-to-end, data scientists will have the full context to identify the right problems and develop usable solutions. It can also lead to innovative ideas that specialists, with their narrow context, might miss. Overall, it increases the ability to deliver value.
Iteration and learning rate is increased. With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.
- Communication and coordination:
Communication and coordination overhead is reduced. With multiple roles comes additional overhead. Let’s look at an example of a data engineer (DE) cleaning the data and creating features, a data scientist (DS) analysing the data and training the model, and a machine learning engineer (MLE) deploying and maintaining it. What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.
The DE and DS need to communicate on what data is (and is not) available, how it should be cleaned (e.g., outliers, normalisation), and which features should be created. Similarly, the DS and MLE have to discuss how to deploy, monitor, and maintain the model, as well as how often it should be refreshed. When issues occur, we’ll need three people in the room (likely with a PM) to triage the root cause and next steps to fix it.
It also leads to additional coordination, where schedules need to be aligned as work is executed and passed along in a sequential approach. If the DS wants to experiment with additional data and features, we’ll need to wait for the DE to ingest the data and create the features. If a new model is ready for A/B testing, we’ll need to wait for the MLE to (convert it to production code) and deploy it.
While the actual development work may take days, the communication back-and-forth and coordination can take weeks, if not longer. With end-to-end data scientists, we can minimize this overhead as well as prevent technical details from being lost in translation.
(But, can an end-to-end DS really do all that? I think so. While the DS might not be as proficient in some tasks as a DE or MLE, they will be able to perform most tasks effectively. If they need help with scaling or hardening, they can always get help from specialist DEs and MLEs.)
But as a PM, BA, and additional members are included, this leads to greater than linear growth in communication and coordination costs. Thus, while each additional member increases total team productivity, the increased overhead means productivity grows at a decreasing rate.
- multiple roles
Iteration and learning rate is increased. With greater context and lesser overhead, we can now iterate, fail (read: learn), and deliver value faster.
There’s greater ownership and accountability. Having the data science process split across multiple people can lead to diffusion of responsibility, and worse, social loafing.
If things get lost-in-translation or if results are unexpected, who is responsible? With a strong culture of ownership, everyone steps up to contribute in their respective roles. But without it, work can degenerate into ass-covering and finger-pointing while the issue persists and customers and the business suffers.
Having the end-to-end data scientist take ownership and responsibility for the entire process can mitigate this. They should be empowered to take action from start to finish, from the customer problem and input (i.e., raw data) to the output (i.e., deployed model) and measurable outcomes.
Diffusion of responsibility: We are less likely to take responsibility and act when there are others present. Individuals feel less responsibility and urgency to help if we know that there are others also watching the situation.
Social loafing: We exert less effort when we work in a group vs. working alone. In the 1890s, Ringelmann made people pull on ropes both separately and in groups. He measured how hard they pulled and found that members of a group tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone.
- For (some) data scientists, it can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction, which is closely tied to autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
Autonomy: By being able to solve problems independently. Instead of waiting and depending on others, end-to-end data scientists are able to identify and define the problem, build their own data pipelines, and deploy and validate a solution.
Mastery: In the problem, solution, outcome from end-to-end. They can also pick up the domain and tech as required.
Purpose: By being deeply involved in the entire process, they have a more direct connection with the work and outcomes, leading to an increased sense of purpose.
- specialist experts
Being end-to-end is not for everyone (and every team) though, for reasons such as:
Wanting to specialize in machine learning, or perhaps a specific niche in machine learning such as neural text generation (read: GPT-3 primer). While being end-to-end is valuable, we also need such world-class experts in research and industry who push the envelope. Much of what we have in ML came from academia and pure research efforts.
No one achieves greatness by becoming a generalist. You don’t hone a skill by diluting your attention to its development. The only way to get to the next level is focus. – John C. Maxwell
Lack of interest. Not everyone is keen to engage with customers and business to define the problem, gather requirements, and write design documents. Likewise, not everyone is interested in software engineering, production code, unit tests, and CI/CD pipelines.
Others have also made arguments for why data scientists should specialize (and not be end-to-end).


14. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment and why this achievement is significant to you.
`proudest achievement`, `conflict`

15. Tell me about your greatest professional failure and how you recovered.
`failure`
Allocate tasks to team members in parallel to avoid blockers. Set up reasonable deadline as use advantages of everyone.

• Know yourself: Take the time to review your own resume as your interviewer will almost certainly ask about key events in your work history.
• Motivation and collaboration: Different interviewers will ask different questions, typically seeking two signals in particular:
    • Motivation: What’s your motivation? Why do you want to work at Facebook? Why are you working as a software engineer?
    • Collaboration: How do you collaborate with peers? How do you resolve conflicts?

• Have concrete examples or anecdotes: Support each question with examples. Some typical behavioral interview questions are:
    • What were some of the best things you’ve built?
    • What are you proud of?
    • What could you have done better?
    • What were some successful collaborations you’ve had?
    • Tell me about a time when you advocated for and pushed your own ideas forward despite opposition?
    • How do you deal with conflict?
    • How do you like to give and receive feedback?
    • What kinds of technologies are you most excited about?
    • Why Facebook?
