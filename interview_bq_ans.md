To excel in answering this behavioral question for an AWS Applied Scientist L6 role, you'll want to structure your response using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and emphasize your problem-solving skills, data-driven decision-making, and ability to innovate while aligning with AWS's core values like customer obsession, ownership, and delivering results.

Here’s how you can structure your response:
1. Situation:
Start by briefly setting the context. Describe a challenging problem you encountered in your role as a machine learning engineer that had multiple potential solutions. Ensure the scenario is relevant to the work you would do at AWS, such as a situation involving scalability, efficiency, or innovation in ML model deployment or data processing.

Example:
"In my previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Company], I was tasked with optimizing our recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The existing system was struggling to scale efficiently as the dataset grew, leading to slower response times and less personalized recommendations."

2. Task:
Explain the specific challenge you faced. Focus on the complexity of the problem, the different possible approaches you could have taken, and why it was important to choose the right solution.

Example:
"The challenge was to enhance the system’s scalability and improve the accuracy of recommendations while minimizing latency. I had several potential approaches: optimizing the existing collaborative filtering algorithm, migrating to a deep learning-based approach, or implementing a hybrid model that combined collaborative filtering with content-based filtering."

3. Action:
Detail the process you followed to evaluate the options and decide on the best course of action. Highlight your analytical approach, including any data analysis, experimentation, and consultations with stakeholders. Emphasize your alignment with AWS principles like 'Customer Obsession' and 'Think Big.'

Example:
"To determine the best solution, I conducted a thorough analysis of the trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and complexity for each approach. I started by analyzing the limitations of the existing algorithm and then ran several small-scale experiments with both deep learning and hybrid models to compare their performance. I also considered the long-term maintainability and the potential impact on user experience.

After analyzing the results, I found that the deep learning approach provided the highest accuracy but at the cost of increased latency and complexity. On the other hand, the hybrid model struck a good balance, significantly improving accuracy and scalability without compromising response time. I presented these findings to the team, highlighting how the hybrid model would align with our long-term goals of delivering personalized, fast recommendations to our customers."

4. Result:
Describe the outcome of your decision. Quantify the impact where possible, such as improvements in system performance, user satisfaction, or business metrics. Reflect on what you learned and how this experience could be applied in the AWS role.

Example:
"We implemented the hybrid model, and the results were outstanding. The system’s accuracy improved by 20%, while response times were reduced by 30%. Additionally, the scalable nature of the model allowed us to handle a growing user base without degradation in performance. This change not only enhanced the customer experience but also contributed to a 15% increase in overall sales over the next quarter.

This experience reinforced the importance of balancing technical innovation with practical constraints and aligning solutions with broader business objectives—a perspective I would bring to the AWS Applied Scientist role, particularly in designing and scaling machine learning solutions that meet customer needs."

This response showcases your ability to navigate complex problems, make data-driven decisions, and deliver impactful results—all key attributes for an AWS Applied Scientist. It also demonstrates how you think big while focusing on customer satisfaction and operational excellence, aligning with AWS’s leadership principles.

### 2 Question: When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?
When answering this question for an AWS Applied Scientist L6 role, you’ll want to demonstrate your ability to take calculated risks, learn from mistakes, and grow from failures—all while aligning with AWS leadership principles like "Learn and Be Curious," "Bias for Action," and "Earn Trust." Here’s how you can structure your response:
1. Situation:
Begin by describing a scenario where you took a calculated risk or made a decision that didn’t pan out as expected. Choose an example that is relevant to the kind of work you’d do at AWS, such as an ML project, experimentation with a new algorithm, or a system design decision.

Example:
"In my previous role as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Company], I was leading a project to develop a real-time fraud detection system. The system was critical for the company as it needed to process transactions in real-time while accurately detecting fraudulent activities. Given the urgency and importance of the project, I decided to take a risk by implementing a cutting-edge, yet experimental, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that promised high accuracy and low false positives."

2. Task:
Explain what was at stake and why you chose to take the risk. Highlight any challenges or uncertainties you faced in making the decision.

Example:
"The task was to deliver a system that could effectively identify fraud in real-time, without causing unnecessary delays in transaction processing. The experimental algorithm was untested in production environments, but I believed it had the potential to outperform traditional methods. The risk was that if the algorithm didn’t work as expected, it could either miss fraudulent transactions or, worse, flag too many legitimate ones, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential financial losses."

3. Action:
Describe the steps you took after realizing the risk wasn’t yielding the desired results. Emphasize your problem-solving skills, how you communicated with stakeholders, and your commitment to delivering results.

Example:
"After deploying the system, we quickly encountered issues—false positives were higher than expected, causing unnecessary transaction blocks and frustration for our customers. Realizing the severity of the situation, I immediately convened a meeting with the team to discuss the problem. We analyzed the algorithm's performance in detail and compared it to a more traditional supervised learning model we had initially considered.

I acknowledged my mistake in choosing the experimental approach without enough real-world validation and made the decision to roll back to the more reliable supervised model temporarily while we continued to refine the unsupervised algorithm. I also set up a shadow testing environment where we could safely test the experimental model on live data without impacting the customer experience."

4. Result:
Discuss the outcome of your actions and how you managed to turn the situation around. Quantify the results if possible, and explain what you learned from the experience.

Example:
"By switching back to the traditional model, we stabilized the system and regained customer trust. In the shadow testing environment, we were able to identify and correct the weaknesses in the unsupervised algorithm, ultimately improving its performance. Six months later, after extensive testing and iteration, we successfully redeployed the refined algorithm, which reduced fraud detection errors by 25% without increasing false positives.

This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly validating experimental approaches in controlled environments before deploying them in critical systems. It also reinforced the value of being transparent with stakeholders when things don’t go as planned and the importance of having contingency plans. I’ve since become more diligent in balancing innovation with caution, ensuring that any risks I take are well-informed and backed by data."

5. Growth:
Reflect on how the experience helped you grow as a professional and how it will inform your approach in the future.

Example:
"This experience significantly shaped my approach to risk-taking in machine learning projects. I’ve become more rigorous in my validation processes, and I now prioritize building safety nets when deploying new technologies. Additionally, it enhanced my ability to manage setbacks effectively and reinforced the importance of fostering a culture where learning from mistakes is encouraged. These lessons have made me a more resilient and thoughtful applied scientist, qualities I believe will be invaluable in the fast-paced, innovative environment at AWS."

This response demonstrates your ability to take risks, learn from failures, and turn challenges into opportunities for growth—all while maintaining a focus on delivering results and maintaining trust. These are key attributes for a senior role at AWS.
