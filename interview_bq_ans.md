After the meeting, I decided to try and find a solution to this problem. I checked the source code and met up with the individual team members, and it is apparent that they are using different ways to visualize the model outputs and are not familiar with other tools. After some investigation work, I write code to adopt a visualization API to our source code from an open-source tool and provide a standard for the plots. From that day on, the members could easily call the API to output unified visualization plots and do not need to write their own code. It makes the visualizations more intuitive and standard and saves them a lot of time.`

Example: "Before making the switch, I conducted a thorough analysis of the new algorithm’s potential impact, including running simulations and A/B testing on a small subset of data. I also benchmarked the new algorithm against the existing one to compare performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, and resource usage.

To mitigate the risk, I proposed implementing the new algorithm in a phased approach. First, I tested it on a small portion of the live traffic to monitor its real-world performance and ensure it wouldn’t negatively impact the user experience. I set up monitoring tools to track key metrics in real time and created a rollback plan in case the new algorithm underperformed.

I communicated the potential risks and benefits to key stakeholders, ensuring they were aware of the calculated nature of the risk and were on board with the plan."

4. Result: Discuss the outcome of your actions. Highlight the success of the risk you took and any positive impact it had on the project or organization.

Example: "The calculated risk paid off. The new algorithm outperformed the existing model by 15% in terms of recommendation accuracy, which led to a noticeable increase in customer engagement and a 10% boost in sales over the following quarter. The phased approach allowed us to safely transition to the new algorithm without any major disruptions.

The success of this initiative demonstrated the value of taking calculated risks and reinforced the importance of innovation in our approach to improving the platform. The project was recognized internally, and the methodology I used for risk assessment and phased implementation became a template for future upgrades."

5. Reflection: Conclude by reflecting on what you learned from the experience and how it has influenced your approach to taking risks in the future.

Example: "This experience taught me the importance of balancing innovation with careful risk management. It reinforced my belief that taking calculated risks, when done with proper analysis and preparation, can lead to significant improvements and competitive advantages.

`I was working on a research project and is focused on training deep learning models to recognize user sentiments with limited examples. By chance, I know that some teams in big companies were working on a similar project. I knew that I might be behind them as I do not have enough training resources as big companies, and if they released the work earlier, I would lose many credits and recognitions for my work. So I made a calculated risk, that I decided to mainly focus on the few-shot part, which requires a few examples to train models, and I am also very familiar with this part. Instead, I skip the less familiar zero-shot experimental part where no training examples are available for the models. I quickly trained models and collected the results and analysis into a research paper, and then I released my work. My work turns out to receive lots of attention, and there are several follow-ups and good suggestions. Of course, I received some interest for the zero-shot part results, and I adopted feedbacks and added up the results soon. I think my calculated risk is worth it as my work received lots of attention and many papers follow my work. Besides, the feedbacks make my work better on the following versions.`

`I was working on a project with limited resources and time, in which the task required to train neural networks to classify movie reviews. However, due to time and budget limit, I could not use several GPUs to train my model because it would cost a lot if I ran multiple experiments, also multiple experiments will take me a lot of time. To complete the project, I made a good plan with priorities. I first carefully survey online related works and blogs, then design better flows of the model architecture. The pipeline requires light models rather than heavy models with lots of parameters. I also adopt several techniques to accelerate my training process. It turns out my model only needs two GPUs to get a good performance, and previously it usually took eight GPUs to finish the whole training process. Besides, It also takes seven hours to finish the entire training process and is much faster than the previous 15 hours. Hence, I could run all my experiments even with limited time, and I could spend extra time to analyze results and write a good document, and the project was finished with high standards and qualities. I learned that we could invent better ways to reduce our resources or save time.`

`I was working on a project during my internship, and the project aimed to detect user domains with good performance during a interaction with customers. After deploying the project, some users commented that the inference time is slow if there is large-scale test data. I feel it is my responsibility to achieve good performance on user data and think about how to accelerate the inference time. As fast inference time could make models more scalable, it could also save user time and money. I spoke with my manager and suggested optimizing architectures to accelerate the model inference. At first, the manager disagreed because he thought one could use more GPU resources or light and smaller version of the model to make the inference faster than optimizing the model architecture. To convince him, I did experiments to analyze how much money and time we will save, and the performances gap between the light version and the normal version of the model. I also provide simple ways to optimize the model inference structure. After later meetings with figures and numbers, the manager was convinced and agreed to my proposal. As a result, the users are satisfied with the application on large-scale data. My proposed techniques were further used on similar projects.`
