### python
Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable `list` is called a `tuple`.

#### Functions
- `Making an Argument Optional`
Calling this function with a first and last name is straightforward. If we’re using a middle name, however, we have to make sure the middle name is the last argument passed so Python will match up the positional arguments correctly.
`def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name=''):`

- `Passing an Arbitrary Number of Arguments`
Python allows a function to collect an arbitrary number of arguments from the calling statement.
`def make_pizza(*toppings):`
The `asterisk` in the parameter name `*toppings` tells Python to make a `tuple` called toppings, containing all the values this function receives.

- `Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments`
If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed last in the function definition. Python matches positional and keyword arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final parameter.
`def make_pizza(size, *toppings):`
For example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that parameter must come before the parameter `*toppings`.

- `Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments`
Sometimes you’ll want to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, but you won’t know ahead of time what kind of information will be passed to the function. In this case, you can write functions that accept as many `key-value pairs` as the calling statement provides.
You’ll often see the parameter name `**kwargs` used to collect nonspecific keyword arguments.
`def build_profile(first, last, **user_info):`
The definition of build_profile() expects a first and last name, and then it allows the user to pass in as many name-value pairs as they want. The double asterisks before the parameter `**user_info` cause Python to create a dictionary called user_info containing all the extra name-value pairs the function receives. Within the function, you can access the key-value pairs in user_info just as you would for any dictionary.

- `Styling Functions`
If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equal sign:
`def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')`

#### Classes
```python
❶ class Dog:
    """A simple attempt to model a dog."""

❷     def __init__(self, name, age):
        """Initialize name and age attributes."""
❸         self.name = name
        self.age = age

❹     def sit(self):
        """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} is now sitting.")

    def roll_over(self):
        """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
        print(f"{self.name} rolled over!")
```
- `Inheritance`
When you create a child class, the parent class must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file.
The `super() function ❹` is a special function that allows you to call a method from the parent class.

```python
❶ class Car:
    """A simple attempt to represent a car."""

    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """Initialize attributes to describe a car."""
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer_reading = 0

    def get_descriptive_name(self):
        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"
        return long_name.title()

    def read_odometer(self):
        """Print a statement showing the car's mileage."""
        print(f"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.")

    def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        """Set the odometer reading to the given value."""
        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:
            self.odometer_reading = mileage
        else:
            print("You can't roll back an odometer!")

    def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        """Add the given amount to the odometer reading."""
        self.odometer_reading += miles

❷ class ElectricCar(Car):
    """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

❸     def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """Initialize attributes of the parent class."""
❹         super().__init__(make, model, year)
❶         self.battery_size = 40

❷     def describe_battery(self):
        """Print a statement describing the battery size."""
        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())
my_leaf.describe_battery()
```

- `Instances as Attributes`
For example, if we continue adding detail to the ElectricCar class, we might notice that we’re adding many attributes and methods specific to the car’s battery. When we see this happening, we can stop and move those attributes and methods to a separate class called Battery. Then we can use a Battery instance as an attribute in the ElectricCar class:

```python
class Car:
    --snip--

class Battery:
    """A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car."""

❶     def __init__(self, battery_size=40):
        """Initialize the battery's attributes."""
        self.battery_size = battery_size

❷     def describe_battery(self):
        """Print a statement describing the battery size."""
        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")


class ElectricCar(Car):
    """Represent aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """
        Initialize attributes of the parent class.
        Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.
        """
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
❸         self.battery = Battery()

my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())
my_leaf.battery.describe_battery()
```
In the ElectricCar class, we now add an attribute called self.battery ❸. This line tells Python to create a new instance of Battery (with a default size of 40, because we’re not specifying a value) and assign that instance to the attribute self.battery.
❸ This line tells Python to look at the instance my_leaf, find its battery attribute, and call the method describe_battery() that’s associated with the Battery instance assigned to the attribute.

- `Importing a Single Class`

```python
❶ from car import Car

my_new_car = Car('audi', 'a4', 2024)
print(my_new_car.get_descriptive_name())

my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23
my_new_car.read_odometer()
```
The import statement ❶ tells Python to open the car module and import the class Car.

- `Storing Multiple Classes in a Module`
You can store as many classes as you need in a single module, although each class in a module should be related somehow. The classes Battery and ElectricCar both help represent cars, so let’s add them to the module car.py.

```python
"""A set of classes used to represent gas and electric cars."""

class Car:
    --snip--

class Battery:
    """A simple attempt to model a battery for an electric car."""

    def __init__(self, battery_size=40):
        """Initialize the battery's attributes."""
        self.battery_size = battery_size

    def describe_battery(self):
        """Print a statement describing the battery size."""
        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

    def get_range(self):
        """Print a statement about the range this battery provides."""
        if self.battery_size == 40:
            range = 150
        elif self.battery_size == 65:
            range = 225

        print(f"This car can go about {range} miles on a full charge.")
class ElectricCar(Car):
    """Models aspects of a car, specific to electric vehicles."""

    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        """
        Initialize attributes of the parent class.
        Then initialize attributes specific to an electric car.
        """
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.battery = Battery()
```

- `Importing Multiple Classes from a Module`
You import multiple classes from a module by separating each class with a comma ❶. Once you’ve imported the necessary classes, you’re free to make as many instances of each class as you need.
```python
❶ from car import Car, ElectricCar

❷ my_mustang = Car('ford', 'mustang', 2024)
print(my_mustang.get_descriptive_name())
❸ my_leaf = ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())
```

- `Importing an Entire Module`

```python
❶ import car

❷ my_mustang = car.Car('ford', 'mustang', 2024)
print(my_mustang.get_descriptive_name())

❸ my_leaf = car.ElectricCar('nissan', 'leaf', 2024)
print(my_leaf.get_descriptive_name())
```

- `Styling Classes`
Class names should be written in CamelCase. To do this, capitalize the first letter of each word in the name, and don’t use underscores. Instance and module names should be written in lowercase, with underscores between words.
Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class definition. The docstring should be a brief description of what the class does, and you should follow the same formatting conventions you used for writing docstrings in functions. Each module should also have a docstring describing what the classes in a module can be used for.
You can use blank lines to organize code, but don’t use them excessively. Within a class you can use one blank line between methods, and within a module you can use two blank lines to separate classes.
If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module that you wrote, place the import statement for the standard library module first. Then add a blank line and the import statement for the module you wrote. In programs with multiple import statements, this convention makes it easier to see where the different modules used in the program come from.
