the next interview will provide a more holistic view of their capabilities and potential fit for the team.

Technical Depth Assessment: In a follow-up interview, it would be beneficial to assess the candidate's technical depth
in specific areas relevant to the role. Present them with scenarios or questions that require in-depth knowledge to
gauge their expertise accurately. Problem-Solving and Time Management: Provide another coding problem that assesses
their problem-solving skills and ability to manage time effectively. This will help determine their capacity to handle
complex technical challenges under pressure. Effective Communication Test: Present the candidate with a technical
scenario and observe how effectively they communicate their thoughts and solutions. This will help assess their ability
to convey ideas concisely and collaborate with team members. Additional Comments:
The candidate's enthusiasm and willingness to engage are encouraging. Addressing the identified areas of concern will
allow us to better understand their potential to contribute effectively in a leadership role.

Problem-Solving and Communication: In a follow-up interview, provide complex scenarios that require clarifying questions
to understand fully. Observe how the candidate engages in back-and-forth communication to gather information, make
decisions, and provide solutions. Collaborative Interaction: Conduct a role-play exercise where the candidate needs to
collaborate with the interviewer to solve a technical challenge. This will help assess their ability to engage in active
discussions and work collaboratively. Communication Skills Test: Present the candidate with a technical concept and ask
them to explain it succinctly. This will help evaluate their ability to convey ideas clearly and concisely. Additional
Comments:
