### a movie recommender application powered by LLMs
In this chapter, we explored how LLMs could change the way we approach a recommendation system task. We started from the analysis of the current strategies and algorithms for building recommendation applications, differentiating between various scenarios (collaborative filtering, content-based, cold start, etc.) as well as different techniques (KNN, matrix factorization, and NNs).

We then moved to the new, emerging field of research into how to apply the power of LLMs to this field, and explored the various experiments that have been done in recent months.

Leveraging this knowledge, we built a movie recommender application powered by LLMs, using LangChain as the AI orchestrator and Streamlit as the front-end, showing how LLMs can revolutionize this field thanks to their reasoning capabilities as well as their generalization. This was just one example of how LLMs not only can open new frontiers, but can also enhance existing fields of research.
