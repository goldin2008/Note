# 1st Interview

1. Talk about linear regression, why it is called linear?
2. Talk about logistic regression, is it linear? 
3. If we can use one non-linear neuron to train a model, why do we need a lot of layers in our model
4. How do we detect if model is overfitting?
5. Talk about one project that you did, what was the objective function, limitations, future scope
6. Decision trees → do they capture non-linearity? 
7. Can you use decision tree to make a non-linear boundaries like a quadratic one
8. Explain k-nearest neighbour algo
9. Gates can be implemented in 1 or 2 hidden layers, don't need more layers
    1. concept of making gates using neural network


# 2nd Interview

1. Travelling Salesman Project
    1. Open MP how did you parallelise the algorithm exactly?
    2. why cant you parallelise stuff in python?
    3. Some synchronisation stuff 
2. Community Detection Algorithms
    1. what is modularity expression?
    2. What is condition for convergence of modularity based algorithm?
3. Page Rank Project
    1. What is the condition for convergence of page rank?
    2. ergodicity of a matrix
    3. laplacian of a graph
4. Satellite Image
    1. Attention in Images in a CNN
    2. how i‍‌‌‍‌‍‌‍‍‌s attention added in a CNN?
    3. 16 images of a town for the same class, how will you use so many images
        -1. wanted to use attention
        -2. other methods → random cropping, reshaping, different images in different epochs
    4. Image as word vector can be fed row wise with ordering information
    5. CNN vs Bert of 16 images → what is the difference?
    6. Sequence to Sequence model in Vision Scenario
