## Container and Kubernetes
`What is Docker`
Docker is a container management system. Containers are objects that contain your application and it's environment, in a way that isolates it from your actual machine's operating system. Think of it as a computer-within-a-computer, but not as separated as a virtual machine. This way, you don't have to worry quite so much about getting the right environment or file system for your application to run--it will run anywhere that can host a container, which makes sharing and deploying your application a breeze.

If you've never used docker before, that's ok! We'll learn a bit today. I'd also encourage you to check out some other tutorials when you have some time, like this one or the first few sections of this one, or this mini-tutorial.

Installing docker
You will need to install some software onto your computer. This requires privileged access, so go ahead and request privileges from the Privileges App

For Mac:
Install Docker for Mac on Dockerhub or Artifactory or Install via homebrew.

```bash
brew upgrade
brew install --cask docker
```
If you haven't upgraded brew in a while, the first step may take some time.

`What is Kubernetes?`
Docker and other container technologies are currently taking the infrastructure world by storm. Ideal for microservice architectures and environments that scale rapidly or have frequent releases, [Docker has seen a rapid increase in usage](https://www.datadoghq.com/docker-adoption/#1) over the past two years. But containers introduce significant, unprecedented complexity in terms of orchestration. Thatâ€™s where Kubernetes enters the scene.
