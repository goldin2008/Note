## Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this style guide is to provide direction for a consistent and professional look and feel across all of our model documentation (e.g., white papers, validation reports, annual reviews, etc.).
This style guide will give you the framework to follow as you create your documents while allowing you the flexibility to tell your story and insert additional material as needed (e.g., bullets, tables, figures, etc.). The fonts, primary sections, and heading styles are established for you so that you can focus on writing the content and not have to worry about the style.

## 2 Fonts and Style
We are using Arial, the CO font, throughout all documentation. We've provided several heading levels, so sometimes that Arial font will be bold or italicized. We've broken the fonts and style down by page type for you in the sections that follow, but here's a quick summary of the most commonly used fonts:

### 2.1 Cover Page
- CO logo is centered at the top of the document.
  - The enterprise-wide "CO" logo is provided for you; the logo is not specific to any one line of business (i.e., not the "COB" logo)
- Title of the document:
  - The title is the model name from ModelOne, the system of record
  - Arial 28, centered, all caps, dark blue
- Sub-title of the document:
  - The subtitle identifies what kind of document it is (i.e., "MODEL DEVELOPMENT WHITE PAPER")
  - Arial 18, centered, all caps, dark blue
- The words "Written By" are already inserted for you:
  - Arial 11, centered, all caps
- The author(s) name and role:
  - Arial 11, centered, italics, initial caps and lowercase
  - List all authors of each document
- Date:
  - Arial 11, centered, all caps
  - The date is a field with a dropdown calendar; the writer clicks or taps the cursor on the field to open it. When the writer chooses a date from the calendar, the date automatically populates the field and appears in Arial 11 all caps in the format of month, date, year (i.e., AUGUST 10, 2017)
- There is no page number on the cover page

### 2.2 Table of Contents Page
- Section title (i.e., "Contents") is provided for you in Arial 24, flush left, initial cap and lowercase
- Section heads and all subheads: Arial 11, initial caps and lowercase
  - Primary section heads: Sit flush left
  - First level subheads: Indented slightly below the primary heads
  - Second level subheads: Indented from the subhead above it
  - Third level subheads, fourth level, etc.: Will not appear in the table of contents, but they will be in the document itself as needed
  - Page numbers: Will sit flush right in the table of contents
- Notes about the Contents page:
  - All contents will be "clickable" â€“ i.e., readers will be able to press "CTRL" + click to follow the link to that specific page
  - Update your "Contents" page after new content has been added to the document
    - To update the table of contents:
      - Click somewhere within the table of contents; that will highlight the entire table in gray.
        - A pop-up box will appear above the word "Contents." It says, "Update Table."
        - Click on the words "Update Table," and another pop-up appears, giving the writer the option to either (A) update just the page numbers, or (B) update the entire table of contents.
        - Choose "Update entire table," and click "OK."
    - Once you click "OK," the Word document will update the table of contents according to the headings in the pages of the document. The heading names as well as all of the page numbers will update.

### 2.3 Sections
- Section title (e.g., "Development Data and Data Proxies") is provided for you in Arial 24, flush left, initial cap and lowercase, and each primary section is already numbered for you
  - Section titles are formatted as "Heading 1" from the "Styles" gallery and will have a thin horizontal line that automatically appears under them
- Section heads and all subheads:
  - First level subheads (e.g., "3.1"):
    - Arial 14, bold, initial caps and lowercase, flush left (i.e., aligned under the primary section name)
    - Formatted as "Heading 2" from the "Styles" gallery
  - Second level subheads (e.g., "3.1.1"):
    - Arial 11, bold, italics, initial caps and lowercase, flush left
    - Formatted as "Heading 3" from the "Styles" gallery
  - Third level subheads (e.g., "3.1.1.1"):
    - Arial 11, bold, italics, initial caps and lowercase, flush left
    - Formatted as "Heading 4" from the "Styles" gallery
      - Note that this level of subhead will not appear in the table of contents, but it will be in the document itself as needed
  - Fourth level subheads (e.g., "3.1.1.1.1"):
    - Arial 11, bold, italics, initial caps and lowercase, flush left
      - Note that this level of subhead will not appear in the table of contents, but it will be in the document itself as needed
- Body copy: All text within the documents will be in Arial 11 and will be flush left and will wrap (not set centered)
- Page numbers: Sit in the footer in Arial 8 in the right-hand corner and have the format "PAGE X of Y" (The words "CO Confidential/Proprietary" are centered in the footer.)

### 2.4 Figures and Tables
Figures should be inserted as needed to help you tell your story.
- Figures are numbered by section and then sequentially (e.g., Figure 3.1, Figure 3.2, Figure 4.1, Figure 4.2, etc.).
- The figure captions (i.e., figure numbers and descriptions) go directly below the figures, flush left, and they do not end with a period.
- Figure captions are set with the figure number in Arial 11, bold, italics, initial cap and lowercase followed by a colon, and the figure description is set with initial caps and lowercase in Arial 11 italics.
- All figures must have a source citation.
  - If your figure is borrowed from another source, cite that source (i.e., source name, author's name, year).
  - If your figure is original work, indicate that in the source citation (i.e., "Original figure," your name, the date it was created, and where the data comes from).

Tables should be inserted as needed to help you convey information in a concise manner.
- Tables are numbered by section number and then sequentially (e.g., Table 5.1, Table 5.2, Table 6.1, Table 6.2, etc.).
- The table captions (i.e., table numbers and descriptions) go directly above the tables, flush left, and they do not end with a period.
- Table captions are set with the table number in Arial 11, bold, italics, initial cap and lowercase followed by a colon, and the table description is set with initial caps and lowercase in Arial 11 italics.
- Table headings will have a dark blue background with white text.
  - Table headings are in Arial 11, bold, initial caps and lowercase, and they can either be centered in the column or sit flush left, depending on the table and its contents.
  - Table headings are set up to repeat from page to page if they span multiple pages.
  - Table contents are in Arial 9 initial cap and lowercase, flush left within the column.
- All tables must have a source citation.
  - If your table is borrowed from another source, cite that source (i.e., source name, author's name, year).
  - If your table contains original information, indicate that in the source citation (i.e., "Original table," your name, the date it was created, and where the data comes from).
Examples:
Figure 2.1: Benchmark Model Calculation Process Flow Chart
Source: Cite the source of this table. If it's original and belongs to the author, indicate that here. An example from another source would be "Source: Reprinted from The World Almanac and Book of Facts by Sarah Janssen, 2018, p. 967, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.
Source: Cite the source of this table. If it's original and belongs to the author, indicate that here. An example from another source would be "Source: Reprinted from The World Almanac and Book of Facts by Sarah Janssen, 2018, p. 967, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.

### 2.5 Source Citations
#### 2.5.1 Figure and Table Sources
- The source citation sits under the figures and tables.
- The word "Source" appears in Arial 9, bold, italics, initial cap and lowercase followed by a colon, and the source information appears in Arial 9 italics, initial caps and lowercase.
- The citation must indicate whether the table or figure is original or whether it's being used from another source. If it's being pulled in from another source, you need to include whether it's being reprinted or adapted.
  - For a book, also indicate the title, the author, the year, the page number, the city of publication, and the publisher.
  - For an article from a journal, also indicate the name of the article, the author, the year, the name of the journal, the volume number, and the page number.
Examples:
Citing a table or figure from a book:
  - Source: Reprinted from Statistical analysis by T. Jones, 2016, p. 203, New York: Harcourt.
Citing a table or figure from an article:
  - Source: Adapted from "Analyzing statistical models," by T. Jones and B. Smith, 2012, Journal of Statistical Analysis, Volume 12, p. 17.

#### 2.5.2 Bibliographic References
- Cite sources within the body of your text by using the author's last name and publication year within parentheses.
- In the reference list, include the full source information.
- We follow the Harvard style of citations.
Examples:
Within the text, a book source would appear like so:
. . . is used as the basis for this estimation (Jones, 2016).
In the reference list, that citation would appear like so:
Jones, T. (2016). Statistical analysis. New York: Harcourt, p. 203.

If you're citing 3 or more authors:
Within the text, the source would appear like so:
. . . is used as the basis for this estimation (Vermaat et al., 2014).
In the reference list, that citation would appear like so:
Vermaat, M., Sebok, S., Freund, S., Campbell, J. and Frydenberg, M.
(2014). Discovering computers. Boston: Cengage Learning, pp.446-448.
If you're citing an organization and there is no specific author:
Within the text, the source would appear like so:
. . . is used as the basis for this estimation (National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], 2009).
In the reference list, that citation would appear like so:
National Fire Protection Association. (2009). Fundamentals of fire-fighting skills (2 nd ed.). Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett, pp. 697-699.
If you're citing a web article:
Within the text, the source would appear like so:
. . . is used as the basis for this estimation (Raina, 2015).
In the reference list, that citation would appear like so:
Raina, S. (2015). Establishing Correlation Between Genetics and Nonresponse. Journal of Postgraduate Medicine, [online] Volume 61(2), p148. Available at: http://www.proquest.com/products-services/ProQuest-Research-Library.html [Accessed 8 Apr. 2015].

### 2.6 Bullets
Bullets will begin with an indent under the text, and each subsequent level of bullets will be indented a little farther.
Example:
3.2 Sample Heading
Text here
- Sample bullet (first level)
  - Sample bullet (second level)
    - Sample bullet (third level)

### 2.7 Footnotes
- Footnote numbers need to be inserted at the end of the sentence in Arial 11 superscript
- The footnote itself will appear at the bottom of the page with a line automatically appearing above it to separate it from the main body of text. The footnote text will be in Arial 9 and will be preceded by the superscript footnote number.
Example:
5.1 Sample Heading
5.1.1 Sample Subhead
Text here with a footnote 1
5.1.1.1 Sample Sub-Subhead
Text here
5.1.1.1.1 Sample of a Third-Level Subhead
Text here
5.2 Sample Heading
5.2.1 Sample Subhead
5.2.1.1 Sample Sub-Subhead
Text here with another footnote 2

### 2.8 Embedding Documents
1 Footnote appears here with the line automatically above it.
2 Footnote appears here.
It's recommended that you do NOT embed any additional documents (e.g., spreadsheets, etc.) into your document. If you convert your document to a PDF, you'll lose access to those embedded documents. Store as many of your documents in Model One as possible, and provide the links in your document. Note that if you store your documents in Model One, you won't need to worry about reviewers having access; they'll be able to access your pertinent documents.

### 2.9 Hyperlinks
If you are inserting hyperlinks in your document, make sure that they are linked to a valid repository, such as Model One, or to a permanent repository, such as TeamSites or GitHub. Avoid referencing temporary or unofficial repositories. Remember that KnowledgeLink is no longer accessible, so anything that had been stored there previously should now be on TeamSites, and be sure you provide the correct, current link for your materials. Also note that if you store your documents in Model One and provide the links in your paper, you won't need to worry about reviewers having access; they'll be able to access your pertinent documents.

### 2.10 Headers and Footers
- Our documents will not have any headers.
- The footers will contain the page number in the format of "Page X of Y," and they will contain the words "CO Confidential/Proprietary."
- Both the page numbers and the "confidential/proprietary" designation will be in Arial 9 pt. all small caps.
- Pages will automatically number sequentially as your document grows.

## 3 Hints and Tips
Here are a few tips and tricks you can use to ensure that the format of your document retains
the correct fonts and style.

### 3.1 Using Format Painter
To put new content in the correct font, you can use "Format Painter." You'll find the "Format Painter" option on the "Home" tab in the upper left corner of your tool bar. Here's a screenshot:
- Highlight the text that you want to copy.
- Click "Format Painter." The paintbrush icon and the words "Format Painter" will appear to be highlighted with a gray background.
- Highlight the text that you want to apply the format to.
- Release your cursor after you've highlighted the section you want to apply it to. The text will format to the text you copied.
- Note that you will need to repeat these steps each time you want to copy and paste a format. In other words, you can't copy a format once and apply it in multiple places. They each need to be done individually.

### 3.2 Aligning Headings, Bullets, and Text
If your headings, bullets, text, etc., are not lining up correctly, turn on your ruler and use the tool to drag your text where you want it. Here's a screenshot:
- Click on the "View" tab at the top.
- You'll see the box for the ruler; click it to insert a check mark in the box. This turns the ruler on.
- You'll see your ruler appear across the top of your page and along the left-hand side margin.
- Click on the triangles within the ruler to drag your text to the left or to the right, depending on where you want it to line up.

### 3.3 "Tell me what you want to do"
For anything that you don't know how to do in Word, you can use the "Tell me what you want to do" feature. Here's a screenshot:
Let's say that you want to insert a page break.
- Click where it says, "Tell me what you want to do," and type in "insert a page break."
- You'll see a small menu pop up as Word guesses what it is you want to do.
- If what you want to do does not appear in that short menu, you'll also see "Get help on [your topic]" near the bottom of that pop-up box. Click on "Get help on [your topic]" to get a more expansive answer to what you want to do.

### 3.4 Adding Additional Heads and Subheads
To add more heads and subheads, you can do one of three things; the first is the preferred
approach:
- Open your navigation pane by clicking "View" from the toolbar and checking the box for the navigation pane.
  - Right click on a heading, and choose from the pop-up menu. You can add a heading before the current one, after the current one, or you can add a new subhead (Word will create the subhead one level down from the one you're currently on).
- Type in your head/subhead, then use Format Painter to copy the format from a previous head/subhead at the same level that you need.
- Copy and paste a previous head/subhead, and change the numbering and wording of it.

### 3.5 Using Bullets
Use bullets when you have 3 or more phrases that complete a sentence. Bullets makes it easier for the reader to follow the flow of the text, and they are easier on the eye than reading many paragraphs of text.
- Each bullet must complete the sentence that introduces it.
- Each bullet should be grammatically parallel to the others.
- Each bullet ends with a semi-colon except the last bullet, which ends with a period.

Examples:
Correct bullet construction:
A list of financial variables will be created based on:
- Variables that are currently being considered in the specialty finance scorecard;
- Variables that have proven to be statistically significant in other models;
- Common variables listed under specialty finance in external databases, such as Bloomberg and SNL;
- Variables suggested by the core panel.
Incorrect bullet construction: (the bullets are not parallel)
A list of financial variables will be created:
- Based on the variables that are currently being considered in the specialty finance scorecard;
- We chose variables that have proven to be statistically significant in other models;
- Common variables listed under specialty finance in external databases, such as Bloomberg and SNL;
- The core panel suggested that we include some variables.

### 4. Grammar Notes
Following are some grammatical points to keep in mind as you write.
- Include articles of speech (for example, "the," "a," "an") in your documents. It makes the document easier for the reader to understand.
- Avoid using vague language (e.g., words such as "some" and "many"). Strive to quantify what you are describing.
- Avoid using superlatives (e.g., words such as "huge" and "great"). You should be objective and balanced and be able to substantiate your points if needed.
- Only proper nouns and titles of tables, etc., need to be capitalized. Watch for random capitalization, i.e., capitalizing common words that aren't names, such as Money Market Account or Savings Account. These are both common terms, not names, so there's no need to capitalize them.
- Most documents should be written in the past tense since the model development has already occurred, or the validation of the model has already occurred. It may sometimes be appropriate to switch to the present tense, but typically not the future tense.
- For the most part, write in the active voice (for example, "We did such-and-such"); it provides transparency and accountability for the work that was done. At times, you'll want to use the passive voice (for example, "Such-and-such was done . . ."). Use the passive voice selectively and intentionally.
- Subjects and verbs must always agree. Singular subjects take singular verbs, and plural subjects take plural verbs.
- If you want to provide examples to help clarify your point, you can use "e.g.," or "i.e.," depending on the context.
  - If you are introducing one or more examples, use "e.g." followed by a comma.
    - "e.g." means "for example" and it allows you to provide multiple examples; it would be used like so: "After work, I'll walk over to a sports arena, e.g., Thunderdome, Victory Court, or Arena Racing."
  - If you are specifying/clarifying what you are referring to, use "i.e." followed by a comma.
    - "i.e." means "in other words" and it narrows down what you are talking about; it would be used like so: "After work, I'll walk over to that new sports arena, i.e., Thunderdome."
