# Data Engineering Nanodegree Program

### Project 1: Data Modeling with Postgres
Students will model user activity data to create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a music streaming app. They will define Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into new tables.

### Project 2: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Students will model event data to create a non-relational database and ETL pipeline for a music streaming app. They will define queries and tables for a database built using Apache Cassandra.

### Project 3: Data Warehouse
Students will build an ETL pipeline that extracts data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team.

### Project 4: Data Lake
Students will build a data lake and an ETL pipeline in Spark that loads data from S3, processes the data into analytics tables, and loads them back into S3.

### Project 5: Data Pipelines
Students continue to work on the music streaming companyâ€™s data infrastructure by creating and automating a set of data pipelines with Airflow, monitoring and debugging production pipelines

### Capstone Project
In this Capstone project, students will define the scope of the project and the data they will be working with to demonstrate what they have learned in this Data Engineering Nanodegree.
