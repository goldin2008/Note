Background:
I am a Software Engineer with ~4 years of Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) and Data Scientist (DS) experience working at Fintech Company. Seeing the recent requirements in big tech companies for MLE roles and our confusion around it, I decided to create a framework for solving any ML System Design problem during the interview. Depending on your expertise and interviewers guide, you might want to emphasize on one section vs. the other (e.g. Data Engineering vs Modeling).

I would love your feedback, specially around the scaling. Also if any interviewer from FANG is looking into this, please provide your feedback.

***Overview***
- Clarify Requirements
- How the ML system fits into the overal product backend
- Data Related Activites
- Model Related Activities
- Scaling

***Details***
1. Clarify Requirements
    - What is the goal? Any secondary goal?
        - e.g. for CTR - maximizing the number of clicks is the primary goal. A secondary goal might be the quality of the ads/content
    - Ask questions about the scale of the system - how many users, how much content?
2. How the ML system fits into the overall product backend
    - Think/draw a very simple diagram with input/output line between system backend and ML system
3. Data Related Activites
    - Data Explore - whats the dataset looks like?
    - Understand different features and their relationship with the target
        - Is the data balanced? If not do you need oversampling/undersampling?
        - Is there a missing value (not an issue for tree-based models)
        - Is there an unexpected value for one/more data columns? How do you know if its a typo etc. and decide to ignore?
    - Feature Importance - partial dependency plot, SHAP values, dataschool video (reference)
    - (ML Pipeline: Data Ingestion) Think of Data ingestion services/storage
    - (ML Pipeline: Data Preparation) Feature Engineering - encoding categorical features, embedding generation etc.
    - (ML Pipeline - Data Segregation) Data split - train set, validation set, test set
4. Model Related Activities
    - (ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) Build a simple model (XGBoost or NN)
        - How to select a model? Assuming its a Neural Network
            1. NLP/Sequence Model
                - start: LSTM with 2 hidden layers
                - see if 3 layers help,
                - improve: check if Attention based model can help
            2. Image Models - (Don't care right now)
            3. Other
                - start: Fully connected NN with 2 hidden layers
                - Improve: problem specific
    - (ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) What are the different hyperparameters (HPO) in the model that you chose and why?
    - (ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) Once the simple model is built, do a bias-variance tradeoff, it will give you an idea of overfitting vs underfitting and based on whether overfit or underfit, you need different approaches to make you model better.
    - Draw the ML pipeline (reference #3)
    - Model Debug (reference #1)
    - Model Deployment (reference#3)
    - (ML Pipeline: Performance Monitoring) Metrics
    - AUC, F1, MSE, Accuracy, NDCG for ranking problems etc.
    - When to use which metrics?
5. Scaling

Be in charge and tradeoffs, tradeoffs, tradeoffs...

***Questions in Interview***

```
1. What size of data are you dealing with?

2. Do you need to be able to serve predictions in real time? 

3. How often do you expect to update your models?

4. How large and experienced is your team â€” including data scientists, engineers and DevOps?

We take the two coding interviews first. And then two team match interviews.

Interview Questions

Q: Give me an example of a project where you used data and machine learning.
Q: Given a binary tree, write a function to find if this tree is a search binary tree or not.
Q: Given an array, write a function that returns a samples from the array.  

Given two sets
words ["cat", "bat", "mat" )
ordering = [c,b,a,t]
Return TRUE when the words in words[] are sorted in lexographic order as in ordering[]  

Python example:

word = "cat"
ordering = ['c', 'b', 'a', 't']

def check_ordering(word, ordering):
    """Recursive approach O(len(ordering))"""
    # Base cases
    if not word:
        return True
    # Recursion
    else:
        letter = word.pop(0)
        print(letter)
        for char in ordering:
            if letter == char:
                index = ordering.index(char)
                print(ordering[index:])
                return check_ordering(word, ordering[index:])
        return False

print(check_ordering(list(word), ordering))

Given an infinite chessboard, find shortest distance for a knight to move from position A to position B  
given a binary image, count the number of 4-directional connected components.  
Serialize and de-serialize a binary tree  
Given two sparse matrices, how would you compute the dot product? 
Given a DAG, write a function to return the length of the longest path. 
Given a tree, write a function to return the sum of the max-sum path which goes through the root node. 
implement functions of constructing binary tree
One problem is implement a trie tree.
How would you build, train, and deploy a system to detect if multimedia and/or ads contents being posted violate terms or contains offensive materials?
How you test your ML models for production scale?
Variation of the number of islands LC question. You have a House, Well & Tree arranged in a large grid with empty spaces in between to show where you can go. How will you go from house to nearest well without hitting a tree? Assume you can only go up.down/left/right and not diagonally and cannot hit a tree else you backtrack.

Interview Questions

Given two strings, A and B, of the same length n, find whether it is possible to cut both strings at a common point such that the first part of A and the second part of B form a palindrome.
have two pointers, first on A and second on end of B. move the pointer l and r (l++, r--) until both values are same( A[l] == B[r]) or l == r. if at any point both are not same just switch the pointer r from B to A and continue. If then it breaks then it is not a palindrome.

You have 52 playing cards (26 red, 26 black). You draw cards one by one. A red card pays you a dollar. A black one fines you a dollar. You can stop any time you want. Cards are not returned to the deck after being drawn. What is the expected payoff following this optimal rule? for this, u need to find what is the optimal stopping rule in terms of maximizing expected payoff.
