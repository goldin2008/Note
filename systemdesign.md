## ML System Design

> https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/566057/machine-learning-system-design-a-framework-for-the-interview-day

Background:
I am a Software Engineer with ~4 years of Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) experience primarily working at startups. I have never had any official 'Machine Learning System Design' interview. Seeing the recent requirements in big tech companies for MLE roles and our confusion around it, I decided to create a framework for solving any ML System Design problem during the interview. My note might be a bit too big for the 45 minute duration of the interview. Depending on your expertise and interviewers guide, you might want to emphasize on one section vs. the other (e.g. Data Engineering vs Modeling).

I would love your feedback, specially around the scaling. Also if any interviewer from FANG is looking into this, please provide your feedback.

Overview
- Clarify Requirements
- How the ML system fits into the overal product backend
- Data Related Activites
- Model Related Activities
- Scaling

Details

- Clarify Requirements
  - What is the goal? Any secondary goal?
e.g. for CTR - maximizing the number of clicks is the primary goal. A secondary goal might be the quality of the ads/content
Ask questions about the scale of the system - how many users, how much content?
How the ML system fits into the overall product backend
Think/draw a very simple diagram with input/output line between system backend and ML system
Data Related Activites
Data Explore - whats the dataset looks like?
Understand different features and their relationship with the target
        - Is the data balanced? If not do you need oversampling/undersampling?
        - Is there a missing value (not an issue for tree-based models)
        - Is there an unexpected value for one/more data columns? How do you know if its a typo etc. and decide to ignore?
Feature Importance - partial dependency plot, SHAP values, dataschool video (reference)
(ML Pipeline: Data Ingestion) Think of Data ingestion services/storage
(ML Pipeline: Data Preparation) Feature Engineering - encoding categorical features, embedding generation etc.
(ML Pipeline - Data Segregation) Data split - train set, validation set, test set
Model Related Activities
(ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) Build a simple model (XGBoost or NN)
        - How to select a model? Assuming its a Neural Network
            1. NLP/Sequence Model
                - start: LSTM with 2 hidden layers
                - see if 3 layers help,
                - improve: check if Attention based model can help
            2. Image Models - (Don't care right now)
            3. Other
                - start: Fully connected NN with 2 hidden layers
                - Improve: problem specific
(ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) What are the different hyperparameters (HPO) in the model that you chose and why?
(ML Pipeline - Model Train and Evaluation) Once the simple model is built, do a bias-variance tradeoff, it will give you an idea of overfitting vs underfitting and based on whether overfit or underfit, you need different approaches to make you model better.
Draw the ML pipeline (reference #3)
Model Debug (reference #1)
Model Deployment (reference#3)
(ML Pipeline: Performance Monitoring) Metrics
AUC, F1, MSE, Accuracy, NDCG for ranking problems etc.
When to use which metrics?
Scaling
Be in charge and tradeoffs, tradeoffs, tradeoffs...

```
1. What size of data are you dealing with?

2. Do you need to be able to serve predictions in real time? 

3. How often do you expect to update your models?

4. How large and experienced is your team â€” including data scientists, engineers and DevOps?
