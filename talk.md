Hello everyone. The topic of my presentation today is Machine Learning at XX. We know ML is changing the way we work and live. Whether you want to know what's behind the buzzwords or whether you want to perhaps use ML yourself either in a personal context or in a corporation, I hope Today's talk will give you a realistic view of what ML really is.

So what is ML? You might have heard some buzzwords in the media, such as machine learning, deep learning or neural networks. What do these terms mean? What is relationship between them?

If we were to draw a Venn diagram showing how all these concepts put together, this is what it may look like. AI is this huge set of tools for making computers behave intelligently and it includes explicit programming. ML is part of AI and DL is a very specific class of algorithms within ML.

So let's go back to this question. What is ML? Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is a definition by Arthur Samuel many decades ago. Arthur Samuel was a pioneer in the field of machine learning, who was famous for building a checkers playing program. Actually, There are several definitions of ML, but in general, ML allows a machine to learn from data and improve its classification and predictive performance.
